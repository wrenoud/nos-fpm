<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<h1 id="systems-preparation-maintenance">Systems Preparation &amp; Maintenance</h1>
<p>NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey (OCS) uses a wide array of systems, tools, and
procedures to perform modern hydrographic surveys. Due to the variety of
equipment and highly technological nature of operations, a consistent, well-
documented program of systems preparation and maintenance is essential to ensure
that NOAA’s hydrographic field units are capable of producing data that will
meet OCS specifications. These procedures can be broken down into two
categories: Annual Systems Preparation and Periodic Quality Assurance.</p>
<h2 id="1-1-annual-systems-preparation">1.1 Annual Systems Preparation</h2>
<p>Each field unit shall schedule an adequate period of time for Annual Systems
Preparation, typically during winter inport for ships, in which survey systems
will undergo annual calibration, maintenance, and verification procedures as
defined in this chapter. These procedures should also be performed following any
significant period of inactivity and after major changes or upgrades to a field
unit’s hydrographic systems. Unless specifically stated otherwise or assistance
is arranged from another NOAA office, Systems Preparation should be conducted
and documented by field unit personnel.</p>
<p>As a final step in Annual Systems Preparation, prior to the start of survey data
acquisition, each field unit shall perform a Hydrographic Systems Readiness
Review as described in section 1.1.1. This process is simply a formal review of
each hydrographic field unit’s Annual Systems Preparation.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-1-hydrographic-systems-readiness-review">1.1.1 Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) is to
officially document and inform OCS senior-level management of a field unit’s
level of readiness to perform hydrographic surveys that will meet OCS
specifications. This procedure also affords field units the opportunity to
identify any deficiencies that will prevent optimal performance and production
throughout the field season. These deficiencies may include such items as
damaged or unreliable equipment, unmet training needs, and personnel shortages.
Formally documenting field unit requirements will better prepare OCS to provide
support and meet the needs of NOAA’s hydrographic fleet. The Hydrographic
Systems Readiness Review process can be broken down into four basic steps
outlined below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Hydrographic Systems Review Team Organization. A Hydrographic Systems Review
Team shall be organized for each NOAA hydrographic field unit. This team shall
consist of an assigned OCS Representative, typically a hydrographer from either
the Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB) or the Pacific Hydrographic Branch (PHB),
the regional Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) Field Support
Liaison, and the field unit’s Field Operations Officer (FOO) or equivalent.</p>
</li><li><p>Hydrographic Systems Review. The Hydrographic Systems Review Team shall
examine both physical survey systems and documentation for Annual Systems
Preparation requirements outlined in this chapter. After completion of the
review, this team shall brief the Chief-of-Party on the level of field unit
readiness determined,any deficiencies identified, and any recommendations that
could increase the unit’s data quality or general survey efficiency.</p>
</li><li><p>Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo. Within ten working days of
commencing survey operations, the Chief-of-Party shall notify OCS of the field
unit’s hydrographic systems status and level of readiness to complete its
assigned OCS hydrographic survey mission. This notification shall be an email
submission consisting of a digitally signed Hydrographic Systems Readiness
Review Memo (see Appendix 1) that lists system deficiencies identified during
the Hydrographic Systems Review and a plan to address each problem. Any
modification or restrictions in operations that will be necessary in the interim
must also be identified.This digitally signed memo should be sent to
ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. Files shall be named using the following format
&lt;UNITNAME_HSRR_MMDDYYYY.pdf&gt;. For additional HSRR memos, add Addendum or
Amendment &lt;UNITNAME_HSRR_Adendum1_MMDDYYYY.pdf&gt;. This digitally signed
memo should be sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. The following people receive e-mail
sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov:</p>
<p>(a) Chief and Deputy Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division (HSD)</p>
<p>(b) Chief and Deputy Chief, Navigation Services Division (NSD)</p>
<p>(c) Chief, Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP)</p>
<p>(d) Chief, Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB)</p>
<p>(e) Chief, Pacific Hydrographic Branch (PHB)</p>
<p>(f) Chief, HSD Operations Branch</p>
<p>(g) Chief, NSD Navigation Response Branch (NRB)</p>
</li><li><p>Hydrographic Systems Readiness Acknowledgment. Within ten working days of
receiving the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo, the Chief of HSD or
Chief of NSD shall formally acknowledge receipt via digital memorandum to the
field unit’s Chief-of-Party with a copy to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. This memorandum of
acknowledgment shall also state OCS acceptance, qualified acceptance, or
rejection of the field unit’s hydrographic systems readiness. If systems
readiness is partially accepted or rejected, the memorandum shall list any
specific actions required by OCS for the field unit to meet data quality
standards.</p>
</li></ol>
<h2 id="1-2-periodic-quality-assurance">1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Periodic Quality Assurance refers to any additional procedures required by OCS
to maintain or verify continued data quality between annual Hydrographic Systems
Reviews. These procedures vary by equipment type and are generally performed on
a scheduled basis throughout a unit’s field season. Specific requirements are
organize by system type and defined in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="1-3-basic-methods-and-documentation">1.3 Basic Methods and Documentation</h2>
<p>To effectively manage a field unit’s hydrographic systems, a comprehensive
inventory must first be completed, and then continually maintained. A standard
format for a Hydrographic Systems Inventory has been implemented by OCS, as
described in section 1.3.1 . OCS has further established a standardized
hydrographic system database, HiBase, which may be utilized for recording this
inventory as described in section 1.3.2. HiBase is intended to serve as a
centralized database that retains and archives all vessels and hydrographic
hardware and software used fleet-wide.</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Systems Inventory is a critical element of systems
documentation for both Annual Systems Preparation and changes occurring
throughout a unit’s field season. Preparation and maintenance requirements will
vary, typically by survey system category and type. While Periodic Quality
Assurance procedures are relatively easy to manage, the sheer quantity and
variety of tasks to be completed during Annual Systems Preparation can be
daunting. OCS-recommended methods for meeting both Annual Systems Preparation
and Periodic Quality Assurance requirements for standard hydrographic survey
systems are described in detail in sections 1.4 of this document. However,
unless stated that the field unit shall or must follow a specific procedure,
these methods are not mandatory. Field units are encouraged to develop more
efficient and/or accurate methods in consultation with HSD and HSTP personnel.
Note: Any new procedures used must be documented with sufficient detail for the
process to be recreated. Systems documentation shall meet the minimum guidelines
set forth in this chapter and use digital reporting formats supplied in Appendix</p>
<ol>
<li>Each of the forms provided in Appendix 1 has been designed to include
essential information. The bulk of systems documentation is to be maintained by
the field unit and made available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews
and at the request of OCS. Documentation designed for continual maintenance,
such as the Hydrographic Systems Inventory spreadsheet, should be used to
capture changes that occur throughout a field season.</li></ol>
<h3 id="1-3-1-hydrographic-systems-inventory">1.3.1 Hydrographic Systems Inventory</h3>
<p>Each field unit shall complete and maintain a digital Hydrographic Systems
Inventory addressing the four systems categories described below. This
information shall be recorded using the format provided below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vessels - Include all vessels to be used for hydrographic data acquisition.
For new vessels or platform types not commonly used in OCS hydrography,
additional descriptive information with diagrams and/or picture should be
included</p>
</li><li><p>Hardware Systems - Include all hardware systems to be used to acquire
hydrographic survey data.</p>
</li><li><p>Software Systems - Include all software to be used to acquire or manipulate
hydrographic survey data.</p>
</li><li><p>Personnel Roster - Include all personnel within the field unit who will be
actively involved in survey operations.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>As this inventory will typically change over the course of the field season or
surveying period, the Hydrographic Systems Inventory shall be updated as changes
occur and submitted as Appendix I of the Data Acquisition and Processing Report
(DAPR) for each project.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-2-hibase-hydrographic-inventory-database-">1.3.2 HiBase (Hydrographic Inventory Database)</h3>
<p>Field units may opt to use HiBase, a standardized hydrographic inventory
database developed by the Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL), for
recording and maintaining their Vessel, Hardware Systems and Software Systems
inventories per section 1.3.1 . Field personnel may register for a HiBase user
account at <a href="https://hibase.noaa.gov">https://hibase.noaa.gov</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-4-vessels">1.4 Vessels</h2>
<p>Vessels are the most fundamental systems in hydrography. Accurate measurement of
the dimensions and dynamic parameters of these platforms is essential to obtain
high quality survey data. Vessel “calibration” consists of measuring, and
estimating error for, static parameters such as the physical positions of
instruments and equipment on a vessel, as well as dynamic parameters such as
waterline and dynamic draft. Measurement, verification, and documentation of
static parameters are addressed in section 1.4.1 . Dynamic parameters are
discussed in section 1.4.2.</p>
<h3 id="1-4-1-vessel-static-offsets">1.4.1 Vessel Static Offsets</h3>
<p>Static offsets of a vessel and its instrumentation are measured for the purpose
of establishing a local reference frame to which all soundings and positions will
be tied. Thus, errors in these measurements will directly translate to errors in
survey data acquired by that vessel. Because much of the equipment installed on
vessels remains fixed from year to year, it may not be necessary to perform a
full survey of every platform during Annual Systems Preparation.</p>
<p>If the results of a previous survey are available and well documented, and the
vessel’s configuration has not changed, simply verifying the existing values
should be sufficient. Even when instrumentation has been moved, if the reference
frame is based on a network of benchmarks independent of the movable equipment,
it may be possible to reposition instruments within the fixed network rather
than resurvey the entire vessel. This procedure will result in a significant
savings of time and effort, but it is imperative that the original survey be
completely and accurately documented to be effective.</p>
<p>The following items shall be positioned as part of any static offset survey
conducted for a NOAA hydrographic survey platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Permanent benchmarks - Benchmarks shall be sufficient in number and position
to maintain the vessel reference frame if instrumentation is disturbed.</p>
</li><li><p>Sonar transducers - All vertical beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders,
and hull mounted side scan sonars that may be used to acquire hydrographic
survey data shall be positioned. Transducers mounted on poles, levers, or other
movable mounts should be surveyed in their fully deployed position. Offsets
shall be measured to the transducer’s phase center, or the origin of the sonar’s
local reference frame. OCS recommends also documenting measurements to a nearby
permanent mounting point, for reference if the sonar head must be removed or
replaced. Consult the corresponding manufacturer’s documentation for further
guidance on the location of transducer phase centers.</p>
</li><li><p>GPS antennae - All survey system GPS antennas shall be positioned. This
includes any GPS antennas that are integrated with differential beacon receivers
and typically only used for differential corrections but could potentially be
used to acquire complete survey position data. Antennas capable of receiving
differential correctors only do not need to be surveyed. Offsets shall be
measured to the phase center of each antenna, a point which may be located
inside the antenna’s housing. Consult the corresponding manufacturer’s
documentation to determine the phase center location of a specific antenna type.
OCS recommends also documenting measurements to the permanent mounting post for
reference if the antenna must be removed or replaced.</p>
</li><li><p>Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - For all vessels equipped with a POS/MV
system, measurements shall be made to the origin of the POS/MV IMU’s local
reference frame. The manufacturer’s documentation will define the IMU’s local
reference frame and identify its origin.</p>
</li><li><p>Reference Point (RP) - A RP shall be established and positioned for each
vessel. This point will define the origin of the local vessel reference frame to
which all survey data will be tied. Note: OCS strongly recommends that a
vessel’s RP be established at the vessel’s approximate center of motion (as
defined below) and coincident with the origin of the IMU’s local reference frame
on vessels equipped with a POS/MV system. By collocating these three points, the
number of physical offset measurements required will be reduced, thus minimizing
sources of error in position and attitude data.</p>
</li><li><p>Center of Motion (CM) - A CM shall be defined and positioned for each vessel.
Establish this point at an approximate location at which the vessel’s roll,
pitch, and yaw axes intersect during static conditions and average loading. The
location of a vessel’s true center of motion will vary based on a combination of
hull shape, loading conditions, and vessel speed; thus it is a dynamic point.
However, a fairly accurate estimation can be made using the vessel’s plans and
empirical observation. Field units should contact NOAA’s Marine Engineering
Division (MED) for assistance when defining a vessel’s CM.</p>
</li><li><p>Towpoint - If the vessel is equipped to perform towed sonar operations, the
towpoint shall be positioned. The position of the towpoint is defined as the
last point of contact between the tow cable and the vessel, typically the top of
a sheave over which the tow cable is led. If the sonar is towed from a movable
point (J-arm, A-frame, etc.), it shall be in its fully deployed position for
this measurement.</p>

<h4 id="1-4-1-1-vessel-measurement-requirements-methods">1.4.1.1 Vessel Measurement Requirements &amp; Methods</h4>
<p>Vessel measurement procedures vary depending on whether the intent is to
complete a full survey of a vessel, conduct a partial survey to position new or
disturbed instrumentation within an existing reference frame, or simply verify
existing offsets when no known changes have occurred. The requirements and
methods for each of these scenarios are described below.</p>
<h5 id="1-4-1-1-1-full-survey">1.4.1.1.1 Full Survey</h5>
<p>A full survey of a hydrographic vessel is required when no prior survey exists
or under any circumstances where all previous surveys are determined to be
unusable. Full vessel surveys should be conducted by National Geodetic Survey
(NGS) personnel or a professional geodetic surveyor. Full vessel surveys can be
both time consuming and expensive; thus, proper documentation is important to
preserve the value of this work.</p>
<p>Examples of conditions that would require full surveys include, but are not
limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A vessel is new or will be engaged in hydrography for the first time.</p>
</li><li><p>Significant modifications have been made to the vessel since the last full
survey.</p>
</li><li><p>New equipment is installed or existing equipment is repositioned, and the
items cannot be accurately referenced to benchmarks from a prior survey.</p>
</li><li><p>New technology or techniques become available that would significantly
increase the accuracy of offset measurements or error estimates for the vessel.</p>
</li><li><p>Complete documentation of the previous survey, including offset values, error
estimates, and procedure descriptions, is not available.</p>
</li><li><p>The hydrographer discovers blunders or unexplained discrepancies when
verifying the results of a previous offset survey. See section 1.4.1.1.3.</p>
</li><li><p>The vessel is involved in an incident, such as a grounding, that has altered
the positions of benchmarks and instrumentation, affecting the validity of the
previous survey.The goal of a full survey is to establish a completely new three
dimensional local vessel reference frame that is independent of any prior vessel
surveys conducted. Information from existing surveys shall not be
incorporatedinto any full survey.</p>
</li></ul>
<h6 id="general-considerations-for-full-surveys">General Considerations for Full Surveys</h6>
<p><em>Accuracy Requirements</em> - OCS has not defined specific numerical values for
required offset measurement accuracy. However, errors introduced in the offset
measurement process will be combined with errors from other sources to produce a
final Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) for each sounding. Measurement errors
must be accurately estimated and small enough for vessel data to meet OCS survey
specifications. More accurate vessel surveys will leave additional room in the
error budget for other sources of error, which may allow the hydrographer to
retain more data or operate under more adverse conditions than would be possible
with a low accuracy survey. Note: Some integrated position and attitude sensors
in use on NOAA platforms, such as the Applanix POS M/V, do have specific
accuracy requirements for offset measurements between system components during
installation. Hydrographers should review the manufacturer’s documentation for
any system-specific requirements.</p>
<p><em>Benchmarks</em> - Benchmarks are permanent, known positions on the vessel used to
identify the established local reference frame. They may be either existing
points, such as antenna posts or well defined features of the vessel, or
monuments specifically created or installed for the purpose of the survey.
Examples of monuments are punch marks, scribe marks, or survey disks.
Hydrographers shall avoid establishing vessel reference frames that utilize
impermanent features of the vessel as benchmarks. The following two factors
should be considered when selecting or installing benchmarks: (1) Permanence -
Benchmarks should be permanent features fixed to the vessel’s hull or
superstructure. Instruments are typically not appropriate benchmarks because of
their potential to be moved. If points such as sensors, antennae, or transducers
are used as benchmarks, the reference frame maybe invalidated if the equipment
is removed, replaced, or relocated. (2) Accessibility and Location - Benchmarks
should be established in locations that are protected, but can be readily
accessed for future surveys. OCS strongly recommends establishing benchmarks
near hydrographic instruments such as sonar heads and antennae. Doing so will
allow sensors to be accurately reintegrated into the network if they are moved.
Since these benchmarks are used to establish a three dimensional reference frame
on the vessel, three benchmarks should be readily accessible from each
instrument location to accurately position sensors, regardless of vessel
attitude.</p>
<p><em>Selection of a Reference Point</em> - Every benchmark network must have a defined
origin (i.e., a reference point) for the local reference frame. OCS recommends
locating this point at the vessel’s approximate center of motion during static
conditions and average loading, as discussed in section 1.4.1 Error Estimation -
Accurate error estimates for a vessel survey are as important as the offset
measurements themselves. While specific sources of error are inherent to each
method of survey (see Surveying Methods below), the following common factors
affect the accuracy of all vessel offset surveys.</p>
<p><em>Setups</em> - This term refers to the number of individual measurements required to
compute the relative position of two benchmarks, literally the number of times
the surveyor’s instruments must be set up to complete the measurement. Multiple
setup measurements use intermediate points as temporary benchmarks between the
two desired points. Physically positioning the measurement instrument on or over
a benchmark or other reference point is a possible source of error, so multiple
setups can increase the measurement error between two points. Hydrographers
should attempt to minimize the number of setups required between benchmarks and
record the number of setups for each leg of the survey.</p>
<p><em>Redundancy</em> - If possible, the hydrographer should arrange the survey such that
no benchmark is tied to the rest of the network by only one measurement.
Ideally, each benchmark should be tied directly to multiple other benchmarks. In
cases where vessel layout makes this impractical, multiple measurements along
the same leg maybe useful. These additional data can be used to improve the
accuracy of positions generated by the survey. While redundant positions can
simply be averaged, a more accurate method of determining a final value is to
combine measurements using a least squares algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Total Error</em> - When estimating the total error for one leg of a vessel offset
survey, individual measurement errors are combined using a “root sum squared”
method, rather than simple addition. For example, in the case of a two setup
measurement, the final error estimate for the leg would be computed as follows:</p>
<p>$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2} $$</p>
<p>where $ \sigma $ is the standard deviation of the total measurement,
$ \sigma_1 $ is the standard deviation of the measurement from the first
benchmark to the temporary benchmark, and  $ \sigma_2 $ is the standard
deviation of the measurement from the temporary benchmark to the second
benchmark.</p>
<p><strong>Vessel Leveling</strong> - Although it is possible to establish a vessel reference
frame that is not aligned with the vessel itself, this adds an element of
complication and potential error that is best avoided. The vessel surveying
process is much simpler if the vessel is removed from the water and leveled
relative to the earth. For ships, this may not be possible, but launches can
generally be accommodated using trailers or jack stands. If a ship is to be
surveyed during a dry dock period, measurements must be corrected for the slope
of the vessel on the marine railway. This angle can be determined by referencing
marine growth along the ship’s waterline prior to pressure washing. Subsequent
offset measurements will need to be corrected for the determined angle of
inclination.</p>
<h6 id="surveying-methods">Surveying Methods</h6>
<p>For the purposes of this manual, offset measurement techniques are broken into
the following two categories:</p>
<p><strong>“Traditional” Methods</strong> - these methods refer to conducting a vessel offset
survey using tools such as steel measuring tapes, T-squares, plumb bobs, and
laser or carpenter’s levels. While these instruments can yield very exact
measurements, particularly on small vessels such as launches, this technique
relies on the assumption that the vessel is level and true. With this method,
the surveyor uses the existing planes and axes of the vessel’s construction,
such as the deck, door frames, and keel lines, to establish the local reference
frame. Not only can significant error be introduced if the vessel is not
actually level and true, it can also be more difficult to estimate error using
traditional methods. OCS recommends using advanced survey methods if equipment
and expertise are available.</p>
<p><strong>“Advanced” Methods</strong> - these methods employ precision survey equipment such as
theodolites, laser range finders, total stations, and optical levels. One
advantage of using these optical techniques is that measurements are independent
of the vessel’s attitude and alignment. Since the surveying instrument can be
positioned anywhere convenient, measurements between benchmarks can often be
accomplished with a single setup, thereby minimizing error. Detailed procedures
for conducting vessel surveys using advanced methods have not been established
by OCS. Field units desiring a full vessel survey using advanced methods should
consult the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison before proceeding. Assistance
using these techniques may also be available through the National Geodetic
Survey (NGS) Geodetic Services Division.</p>
<h5 id="1-4-1-1-2-partial-survey">1.4.1.1.2 Partial Survey</h5>
<p>A partial vessel survey shall be conducted if minor changes have been made to
the vessel configuration, but the most recent full survey has not been rendered
obsolete. Partial surveys are typically appropriate when equipment is removed
and replaced or repositioned on a vessel without disturbing the network of
permanent benchmarks. In such cases, the new position of the instrument can be
determined by surveying its position relative to the undisturbed benchmarks. The
original survey shall then be updated and would remain valid Partial surveys are
significantly less time consuming than full surveys, but are only valid if
benchmarks installed as part of the original survey remain undisturbed. When in
doubt as to whether a new full survey is necessary or a partial survey is
sufficient, field units shall complete a full survey of the vessel.</p>
<p>Partial surveys are basically identical to full surveys, but on a much smaller
scale. The same rules and considerations described for full surveys apply to
partial surveys. Since measurements are typically made over short distances and
require few setups (assuming benchmarks have been installed near instrumentation
as recommended), good accuracy can often be achieved with traditional survey
methods. However, advanced methods may provide a more accurate estimate for
measurement error.</p>
<h5 id="1-4-1-1-3-verification-survey">1.4.1.1.3 Verification Survey</h5>
<p>Verification surveys are conducted to check the validity of pre-existing full
(or combination of full and partial) surveys when no changes to the vessel’s
configuration have occurred. This is the minimum survey required as part of
Annual Systems Preparation and, as such, shall be conducted at least annually.
The purposes of a verification survey are to review the offsets, error
estimates, and documentation of the prior survey, and to check for measurement
blunders, vector algebra mistakes, sign errors, etc.</p>
<p>Verification surveys can be viewed as a “sanity check” of the existing survey
data and may be conducted using traditional methods. Typical procedures consist
of pulling steel tape between benchmarks to verify the offset values and
rechecking the vector algebra to confirm established values. Error estimates in
the original documentation shall be reviewed for consistency and suitability for
the vessel’s current mission. Any discrepancies discovered during a verification
survey may trigger a partial survey or a new full survey of the vessel.</p>
<h4 id="1-4-1-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.4.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Periodic quality assurance checks are simply Verification Surveys, or portions
thereof, performed at the discretion of the field unit. This type of check would
be used if the vessel was involved in an incident, such as a grounding, that
might have altered the positions of benchmarks and instrumentation, affecting
the validity of the annual survey. If changes are found, a partial survey or new
full survey of the vessel may be necessary.</p>
<h4 id="1-4-1-3-documentation-reporting-requirements">1.4.1.3 Documentation &amp; Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>The documentation required for vessel static offset surveys varies with the
extent of the survey conducted. Documentation, as defined below, for static
offset surveys shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review
during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of
documentation for all full and partial surveys shall be transmitted to HSTP. The
dates, basic methodology used, and responsible professional survey agency (if
applicable) for vessel static offset surveys shall be entered in the
Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Any interim survey performed as a quality
assurance check shall be described in the DAPR for all associated projects.</p>

<h3 id="1-4-2-vessel-dynamic-offsets">1.4.2 Vessel Dynamic Offsets</h3>
<p>Dynamic offsets are those parameters of a vessel that are expected to change
over relatively short time periods. The primary dynamic offset is vessel draft.
A hydrographic survey vessel’s draft and, therefore, the vertical position of
the sonar transducer within the water column is affected by many factors,
including the vessel’s loading, weight distribution, and speed through the
water. When addressed as one vessel characteristic, these effects are referred
to as “Dynamic Draft.” Dynamic draft is the sum of “Static Draft” and
“Settlement and Squat”.</p>
<p>Static draft is the draft of the vessel at rest, fully loaded and outfitted for
surveying. This value can be affected by the amount of equipment, fuel,
personnel, and other gear loaded on the vessel, and is also a function of the
density of the water in which the vessel is operating.</p>
<p>“Settlement” is the purely vertical component of this vessel characteristic and
is measured at the vessel’s approximate center of motion. Although this vertical
displacement is in the same direction as heave, settlement is usually filtered
out of recorded heave data because its frequency is much lower than the cutoff
frequency of high pass filters typically associated with heave measurement
devices. As a result, settlement must be measured and corrected for
independently of heave action.</p>
<p>”Squat” refers to the tendency of a vessel’s stern to sink into the water as
speed increases while operating in displacement mode (i.e., not on a plane).
Squat typically results in a bow-up attitude, although a reverse effect may
actually take place at higher speeds for some hull designs. Since echosounders
are generally not mounted directly at a vessel’s center of motion, squat acts on
a lever arm from the center of motion to the echosounder, causing a vertical
displacement of the transducer. On vessels equipped with attitude sensors, this
effect is addressed as a part of attitude measurements and corrections. For
vessels without attitude sensors, squat must be measured and corrected for as a
part of dynamic draft.</p>
<h4 id="1-4-2-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.4.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<h5 id="1-4-2-1-1-static-draft">1.4.2.1.1 Static Draft</h5>
<p>As part of Annual Systems Preparation, static draft shall be measured across the
anticipated range of loading and buoyancy conditions. At a minimum, field units
should track changes in static draft for a sufficient period of time to develop
a statistically significant sample of values from which an error estimate can be
produced. Depending on these results and the requirements of the survey, the
frequency of draft measurements and updates of the HVF necessary during survey
operations will vary. On some vessels, it may be necessary to measure static
draft as often as twice a day, while annual measurements may be sufficient for
others.</p>
<p>Factors influencing the frequency of static draft measurement include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Survey Accuracy Required - If the error associated with static draft
measurement is determined to be acceptable for meeting survey accuracy
requirements, a single static draft value may be sufficient. This value should
be the mean of multiple observations taken over a wide range of loading and
buoyancy conditions for the vessel. If survey accuracy requirements increase,
more frequent static draft measurements may be necessary.</p>
</li><li><p>Loading Conditions - Vessels with a wide range of loading configurations will
require more frequent static draft measurements than vessels with minimal
loading changes. For example, many NOAA ships conduct survey operations both
with and without launches in the davits, which can create a significant
difference in vessel draft. Likewise, a hydrographic survey launch’s static
draft may vary noticeably with the amount of fuel loaded and the number of
personnel embarked.</p>
</li><li><p>Buoyancy - A vessel’s static draft will vary with the density of the water in
which it floats. If the vessel will be operating in waters with a wide range of
densities (most strongly influenced by salinity), more frequent observation of
static draft may be necessary. Additionally, water density may change
significantly with project area, making static draft determined at one location
inappropriate for survey operations in another area.</p>
</li></ul>
<h6 id="1-4-2-1-1-1-static-draft-measurement-techniques">1.4.2.1.1.1 Static Draft Measurement Techniques</h6>
<p>The technique chosen to measure static draft may be influenced by the
anticipated frequency of measurement required. Examples of measurement
techniques include the following: Draft Marks on Hull - During the static offset
measurement survey (see section 1.4.1) the vessel’s hull can be marked with
vertical elevation differences from the Vessel Reference Point. If this method
is used, the hull should be marked on both the port and starboard sides, in the
athwartships plane of the Vessel Reference Point. Static draft is then
determined by averaging the port and starboard readings. Sight Tube - A more
precise method for measuring static draft is a clear plastic or glass sight tube
installed in the interior of the vessel. This method can be particularly useful
on hydrographic survey launches. The lower end of the tube is connected to a
through-hull fitting below the waterline (with a valve at the hull), and the top
is either connected to a through-hull above the waterline or extends
sufficiently high enough above the waterline to prevent flooding. The clear
portion of the sight tube, where measurements will be read, should be installed
directly over (or as close as possible to) the vessel RP and graduated for
direct measurement of the waterline offset from the reference point. Note: The
static draft information is to be placed in the ’waterline’ entry in the CARIS
HVF.</p>
<h5 id="1-4-2-1-2-dynamic-draft">1.4.2.1.2 Dynamic Draft</h5>
<p>At a minimum, dynamic draft shall be measured during Annual Systems Preparation.
Although dynamic draft is a function of both hull shape and weight distribution,
the influence of weight distribution is typically negligible. Thus, dynamic
draft can be measured annually with the vessel in an average loading
configuration, and the results combined with a range of static draft
measurements for a final dynamic draft determination. Vessels with ancillary
trim capabilities (e.g., trim tabs, jet drives, and outboard motors) should
establish operating procedures to standardize vessel trim during survey
operations.</p>
<h6 id="1-4-2-1-2-1-dynamic-draft-measurement-techniques">1.4.2.1.2.1 Dynamic Draft Measurement Techniques</h6>
<p>Settlement and squat are actually two separate parameters, but they can be
easily measured together. If possible, this measurement should be accomplished
in a body of water at least 7 times the vessel draft, where water level ,current
effects, and wave conditions will be minimal for the period of the calibration.
There are three common methods of determining dynamic draft values. Each method
is described below.</p>
<h6 id="optical-level">Optical Level</h6>
<p>This technique uses an optical level to site the height of the vessel moving at
different speeds through the water, relative to a fixed position ashore. The
basic procedures are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set Up - Set up an optical level on shore near a channel or fairway where the
vessel will be free to maneuver. The closer the level station is to where the
vessel will traverse, the more accurate the readings will be. A pier is a valid
location for the level station, but the pier must be a stable structure that
does not exhibit significant movement over time. Level rods should be positioned
on the port and starboard sides of the vessel. If the vessel to be calibrated is
equipped with an attitude sensor, the level rods should be positioned in the
athwartships plane of the vessel’s approximate center of motion so that only
settlement is measured (squat will be measured and corrected in conjunction with
vessel attitude). If the vessel does not have an attitude sensor, the level rods
should be located in the athwartships plane of the sonar transducer, which will
combine squat effects in the measurement.</p>
</li><li><p>Data Acquisition - Run the vessel in opposing directions (either perpendicular
to or parallel with the level station line of sight) at various speeds, ranging
from dead slow ahead to slightly faster than the maximum anticipated survey
speed. On each run, the vessel must be allowed sufficient time to stabilize in
attitude and speed prior to the measurement point. For each speed, a rod
measurement should be taken on each side of the vessel. The port and starboard
values for each speed are averaged to cancel the effect of any current or vessel
list. Before and after each pair of runs, the elevation values for the vessel at
rest should be measured in order to correct for any change in water levels over
the course of the test. The data should be recorded in tabular format, with the
final dynamic draft value for each speed being the difference between the
average at rest readings (before and after each pair of runs) and the average of
the port and starboard underway readings.</p>
</li></ul>
<h6 id="post-processed-kinematic-ppk-gps">Post-Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS</h6>
<p>Note: The technique and analysis use depends greatly on the vessel and the area
in which you are working. If you have any questions, contact your HSTP
representative before proceeding.</p>
<p>This technique uses the vessel’s POS/MV system and POSPac data acquisition and
processing to measure vessel ellipsoid heights at speeds relevant to survey
operations. A polynomial regression of the changes in height is used to
formulate a dynamic draft table with associated uncertainties. The Pydro macro
ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py may be used for the dynamic draft table data analysis.
This macro reads POSPac Smoothed Best Estimate Trajectory (SBET) dynamic draft
calibration data, (optionally) adjusts for tidal water levels, and outputs
graphs and tables per a 3rd or 4th-order polynomial regression. The basic
procedures are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the dynamic draft calibration test is performed in a tidally-active area,
plan on performing the data analysis using the Pydro macro
ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py (see below). This macro includes the ability to
compensate for both discrete-zoned and TCARI water levels. Other data analysis
may be used at the discretion of the field unit. A spreadsheet analysis may be
used, particularly in areas with negligible tides, or during a time when water
level changes due to tide will be negligible.</p>
</li><li><p>Wave conditions need to be minimal as with all dynamic draft measurements.</p>
</li><li><p>It is also assumed that the ellipsoid is relatively parallel to the water
level over the area of this test. Time periods of static vessel heights at the
end of each line will help to confirm this assumption. If there is evidence to
the contrary once data has been acquired, another area may need to be selected
or another technique may need to be used for dynamic draft measurements.</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Data Acquisition - Select an area where the water depth is sufficient to remove
the strong effects of squat due to shallow water. The area should be large
enough that you can acquire data between 2-5 minutes at speed, enough time to
allow the vessel to settle out at speed. Start acquiring POSPac data at least 5
minutes before beginning the test. While consecutive changes in speed can be
used, a one to two minute “rest period” between each speed change is recommended
to capture offsets due to tides, currents or geoid shape. An adequate rest
period length is a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the
particular vessel; i.e., how long it takes for the given vessel to stabilize to
“static” conditions. Run lines in opposing directions taking into account
current magnitudes and directions; data sampling should be balanced between
lines progressing with and stemming the current. It is important to acquire
lines at regular speed intervals over a range that is relevant to the multibeam
survey work of the vessel;e.g., from barely maintaining steerage through 10+
knots, at an interval of 2 knots. Do NOT stop recording POSPac between lines;
PPK processing performs best using uninterrupted sessions of GPS data. Record the
order in which you ran the speeds and what direction you went between each of
the rest periods. A complete written record of the dynamic draft calibration
fieldwork may prove invaluable in troubleshooting peculiar looking results
later.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data Processing - Data is processed in Applanix’s POSPac software through
either a SmartBase solution or a SingleBase solution. POSPac data can be
processed referencing the rapid ephemeris solutions. Final ephemeris data can
take up to 2 weeks to become available, and does not significantly change the
calculated values. The data are processed through the GNSS-Inertial Processor in
the Forwards, Backwards and Combine mode with the Roll, Pitch and Heading
Initialization set to Initialize from the real time solution and the Lever Arm
Standard Deviation ideally known to 3 cm or better (The lever arm standard
deviation should be set based on how well you actually know your lever arms).
SBETs may be decimated to 1 Hz to alleviate the processing load in Data Analysis,
without any detrimental effects. Control station auto-adjust should never be
used for processing SBETs.</p>
</li><li><p>Data Analysis - A time series of both speed and ellipsoid heights, as well as
a plot of speed versus ellipsoid heights should be examined to ensure data
quality and to look for offsets. A polynomial least squares fit regression on
speed versus ellipsoid height is completed with user preferred software. A
minimum of a third order regression should be used. A comparison between the
regression and the plotted data should be completed both through a raw plot with
regression curve and through the ellipsoid height minus regression residuals.
Changes in the ellipsoid height not captured by the curve should be noted and
changes to the regression process may be needed. Take special care to note the
zero speed crossing, as it can result in vertical offsets in the dynamic draft
table. Careful examination here cannot be emphasized enough.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Once a satisfactory curve is obtained, a dynamic draft table can be created
between regular speed increments and the corresponding height from the
regression equation subtracting the zero speed ellipsoid height constant. Since
the table for CARIS HIPS is a correction file, increases in draft with speed
result in positive values in the HIPS table. Uncertainty in the dynamic draft
table is obtained by calculating two standard deviations of the residual data to
regression difference. If uncertainty for each speed is desired the residuals
can be binned by speed and the standard deviation calculated for each bin. Care
should be taken that sufficient data exists in each bin. As mentioned
previously, all of the required data analysis, from SBET to dynamic draft
table–including tide compensation, can be achieved via the Pydro macro
ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py. Complete details about using this macro may be found in
the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.</p>
<h6 id="real-time-kinematic-rtk-gps">Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS</h6>
<p>Procedures are currently being developed for a real-time kinematic GPS
determination of dynamic draft. These methods have not yet been approved by OCS
and shall not be used for Annual Systems Preparation.</p>
<h6 id="echosounder">Echosounder</h6>
<p>This technique uses a vessel’s MBES system to determine dynamic draft. A
detailed procedure is described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data Acquisition -Data should be acquired in an area with a flat seafloor and
relatively shallow water. Water depth should also be at least seven times the
vessel draft to reduce attitude bias. The geographical location should be as
close as possible to a water level station. If the survey time is planned to
minimize currents, adequate data can typically be acquired by running in one
common direction for all vessel speeds. If currents are significant, it will be
necessary to acquire data in opposing directions for each speed and average
the two values. As with the optical level method, vessel attitude and speed must
be stable while acquiring data.</p>
</li><li><p>Line Acquisition -Plan a survey line approximately 1000 meters in length.
Establish a center reference point for three approximately $ 20 m^2 $ reference
areas located at distances of ¼, ½, and ¾ along the line as shown in Figure 1.1.
Acquire data along the line at various RPM intervals, ranging from the minimum
to the maximum speed anticipated for survey operations. Minimize across-track
error during line navigation and establish a constant speed and heading prior to
logging data. Monitor and minimize induced heave during data acquisition. Run
the line in coincidental directions for redundancy. To minimize induced heave,
allow time for the IMU to stabilize before reacquiring data.</p>
<p><strong>(image)</strong></p>
<p>Figure 1.1: Recommended line plan for determining dynamic draft using a
vessel’s echosounder.</p>
</li><li><p>Reference Area Acquisition - At each reference area, acquire data along the
line at the lowest speed possible while maintaining heading and stable attitude
to create a baseline with negligible dynamic draft. It is recommended that
reference area data be acquired both before and after line acquisition to
bracket and evaluate any significant water level variation. Compare these zero
or at-rest settlement and squat measurements with each of the at-speed
measurements to determine offsets caused by speed variation. If the seafloor is
not flat, several passes may be required at each reference area to create an
accurate reference surface. Conduct a sound velocity cast near the center
reference point. The reference area acquisition is considered the &quot;At rest&quot;
depth and should be the baseline to which you compare the depths acquired at
speed.</p>
</li><li><p>If there is concern for induced draft while moving over the targets, an
alternative reference surface calculation can be made utilizing Drift Line
Measurement: If the reference or drift line is run perpendicular to the analysis
line it will produce a swath sufficient enough for data acquisition. If you are
conducting this dynamic draft test on a vessel with a 1.5 meter draft your test
should be performed in at least 10.5 meters (35 feet) of water. At that water
depth the average swath width would be 36.75 meters (122.5 feet).</p>
</li><li><p>Processing Soundings - If the echosounder system used for data acquisition
performs real-time heave filtering, convert the data without applying true
heave. Long-period heave will bias dynamic draft calculations. Random, short-
period heave should cancel out during statistical averaging of reference surface
depths. Filter soundings to reject all but those with the highest data quality
flag.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A surface should contain only the drift line or reference area lines.</p>
</li><li><p>Separate surfaces should be made at each rpm interval (i.e. if lines were
run at 600, 800, and 1000 rpm, create a grid for each of the 600, 800, and 1000
rpm drift lines).</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Sample all line surfaces and the reference surface soundings using an
approximately 3 m x 20 m subset area at each of the three reference areas.
Minimally clean subsets for gross fliers and noise. Select and query all
soundings from each subset dataset and save each CARIS query window as a text
file. This can be done by simply copying and pasting directly into a MS Excel
spreadsheet. Import these text files into MS Excel as tab delimited records. Sort
these Excel data by line ID and calculate the median surface depth (use =MEDIAN
(c#:c#) ) for each speed level at each reference area. Typical sample
populations should be between 3,000 – 5,000 soundings (use =COUNTA (c#:c#) to
check).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reference surface should be sampled first to be used as the control in
the data analysis.</p>
</li><li><p>Coincidental lines should be sampled together in the same surface.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Navigation/Speed - Using the CARIS Navigation Editor, query position fixes for
individual lines within each reference area subset. Save each query as a text
file and import these data into Excel as tab-delimited records. Calculate the
average speed for each RPM in each of the reference areas (use =average (c#:c#).</p>
</li><li><p>Offset Tables - For each reference area, subtract the median reference area
depth from median depths for each RPM/speed interval to calculate relative
dynamic draft offsets. Plot Speed vs. Offset for each of the 3 reference areas
to evaluate data consistency. Average data from the ¼, ½ and ¾ point reference
areas to calculate final dynamic draft values.</p>
</li><li><p>Error Analysis -The standard deviation of each speed correction should be
calculated by comparing the values derived from each surface area. The largest
standard deviation value should be entered into the vessel’s HVF for dynamic
draft error. Note that in CARIS, the squat and settlement is entered in as
“delta draft” or the positive change in draft as the draft increases and
negative as the draft decreases.</p>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="1-4-2-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.4.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Static draft shall be re-measured at whatever frequency determined necessary to
meet survey specifications. However, at a minimum, static draft should be
checked against previous survey values at the start of a new project and
whenever a vessel will be conducting survey operations with an atypical loading
configuration. Dynamic draft shall be re-measured if the vessel’s hull shape is
altered, significant changes in weight distribution of the vessel have been
made, or other physical alterations have been made to the vessel that may affect
dynamic draft values.</p>
<h4 id="1-4-2-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.4.2.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Dynamic offset measurement documentation shall be broken into two separate
sections, one for static draft and one for dynamic draft measurements. All
information listed below should be documented. This documentation shall be
maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic
Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. The dates and basic methodology used
to determine dynamic offset measurements shall be reported in the DAPR for each
applicable project. The actual frequency of static draft measurements, any
significant changes to static draft, and any subsequent changes to dynamic draft
should also be included with this documentation. Static draft measurement
documentation shall include the following: * A complete description of the
procedure used to determine draft and estimate error.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Geographical location where measurements were made and number of observations
used for draft determination.</p>
</li><li><p>Raw draft measurement data in tabular format and error estimate calculations.</p>
</li><li><p>Final static draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.</p>
</li><li><p>The frequency with which draft will be measured during subsequent survey
operations, with justification for this decision.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Dynamic draft measurement documentation shall include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A complete description of the procedure used to determine dynamic draft, with
a chartlet identifying the geographical area where measurements were made.</p>
</li><li><p>Raw data with sufficient explanation of data reduction to enable recalculation
of the final dynamic draft values and error estimates.</p>
</li><li><p>Final dynamic draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Note: Think carefully about the sign of the dynamic draft values placed in the
Draft sensor entry in the CARIS HVF. CARIS expects the change in Z to be a
positive down, so a sinking of transducer creates a shallower depth than the
“true depth”, and the dynamic draft value will be positive. If the vessel rises
in the water, the measured depth will be deeper than the “true depth” and the
dynamic draft value will be negative. Depth= Observed depth – Waterline + change
in depth.</p>
<h3 id="1-4-3-wiring-diagrams">1.4.3 Wiring diagrams</h3>
<p>All field units should maintain up-to-date wiring diagrams for each of their
survey vessels. These wiring diagrams should be reviewed and updated during the
Annual Systems Preparation process.</p>
<h2 id="1-5-hardware-systems">1.5 Hardware Systems</h2>
<p>Hardware systems used by NOAA field units for hydrographic survey operations
consist of a variety of technologically advanced echosounders and attitude
sensors and each instrument must be properly maintained and calibrated in order
to provide quality data.</p>
<p>Calibration, maintenance, documentation, and reporting requirements established
by OCS for common hardware systems used by NOAA hydrographic field units are
described in sections 1.5.1    . New sensors and instruments unique to only one
or two field units may not be addressed in this manual. Likewise, as NOAA’s
organizational expertise with existing systems continues to grow, new and
improved procedures that supersede those documented here will be developed. In
such cases, this section of the FPM shall be used as a guide for the
development, implementation, and documentation of new procedures. If a new
procedure is used, it must be approved by HSTP and documented with sufficient
detail for the process to be recreated.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-1-position-attitude-and-heading-sensors">1.5.1 Position, Attitude, and Heading Sensors</h3>
<p>For OCS hydrographic surveys, vessel position is typically determined using a
variety of GPS based positioning methods, as described in the Hydrographic
Survey Specifications and Deliverables (HSSD). Attitude sensors are often
employed to measure a vessel’s roll and pitch about its RP and any purely
vertical heave action affecting the vessel. The vessel’s orientation about its
vertical axis (i.e., yaw) is generally determined with a heading sensor or
gyroscopic compass. Attitude and heading values measured by these sensors are
typically applied to sounding data during post-processing. Each of the
aforementioned sensors may be stand-alone systems, or they may be integrated
into a navigation system that will collectively determine vessel position,
attitude, and heading.</p>
<p>Note: Not all NOAA hydrographic field units may be outfitted with an attitude
sensor. However, this equipment will be included on any NOAA vessel used to
acquire multibeam echosounder data. Vessel attitude must be measured and applied
to multibeam data to produce accurate soundings. Due to the wide beam angle of
vertical beam echosounders (VBES), attitude corrections are less critical for
this type of data. However, CARIS HIPS is capable of applying attitude data to
VBES when available.</p>
<p>The Applanix POS/MV (Position and Orientation System/Marine Vessel), a GPS-aided
inertial navigation system, is the most common system used by NOAA hydrographic
field units to measure vessel position, attitude, and heading. As such, the
POS/MV calibration and reporting requirements are specifically addressed in this
manual. Field units equipped with alternate position, attitude, or heading
sensors shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to develop
approved calibration and maintenance requirements.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-1-1-applanix-pos-mv">1.5.1.1 Applanix POS/MV</h4>
<p>The POS/MV navigation system will calculate survey-quality vessel position,
heading, and attitude data. Primary system components consist of a processing
unit, two GPS antennas, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is
typically installed at the vessel’s RP for NOAA configurations.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-1-1-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.1.1.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h5>
<p>At a minimum, NOAA hydrographic field units shall calibrate the POS/MV during
Annual Systems Preparation. Additionally, the POS/MV shall be recalibrated after
any IMU or antenna installations, movements, and/or modifications. The
appropriate POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide will contain comprehensive
guidance on system operation and calibration.</p>
<p>Note: Although the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide refers to the
calibration process as “antenna installation calibration,” it should be
performed following any physical antenna or IMU adjustments, not just antenna
installation. Additionally, all IMUs shall be turned in to the regional
Electronics and Engineering Division (EED) depot every three years so that the
units can be shipped to Applanix for factory service and recertification. If a
field unit has been equipped with a Version 4 or higher POS/MV system, it is
possible to perform an additional lever-arm calibration. However, this
calibration should not be attempted without appropriate Real Time Kinematic
(RTK) support. Field units should contact the regional HSTP Field Support
Liaison for RTK support prior to conducting a lever-arm calibration.</p>
<h6 id="1-5-1-1-1-1-offsets-reference-frame-conventions">1.5.1.1.1.1 Offsets &amp; Reference Frame Conventions</h6>
<p>Prior to calibration, POS/MV lever arm distances should be entered, as
necessary, and/or verified in the POS/ MV controller software. Be very careful
not to enter values for offsets that will be applied to data during
post-processing via the HVF. If the IMU is collocated with the vessel’s RP and
CM, the distance from the IMU to the primary GPS antenna (port side for OCS
configurations) and the distance between GPS antennas may be the only offsets
that need to be entered in the POS/MV controller software. Measured antenna
separation distance must be accurate to within 5 mm, per the manufacturer’s
specifications. Refer to the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide for
additional measurement accuracy requirements and coordinate system conventions.
Note: Be certain that offsets entered in the POS/MV controller software
correspond to the local POS/MV coordinate system, which may differ from the
vessel reference frame coordinate system. A summary of coordinate systems for
common OCS systems and software is included in Appendix 1
(Coordinate_Systems.pdf).</p>
<h6 id="1-5-1-1-1-2-performing-the-calibration">1.5.1.1.1.2 Performing the Calibration</h6>
<p>Detailed instructions for performing a POS/MV calibration should be reviewed in
the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide. For a successful calibration, the
POS/MV GPS Azimuth Measurement Subsystem (GAMS) must have data available from 7
or more satellites and a Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) equal to or
less than 3.0. The calibration should be performed at a time when satellite
geometry is good. GPS mission planning software can be used to identify an
optimal calibration time, during which the PDOP will be at a minimum. Mission
planning software is included on the Hydrosoft website
<a href="https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome">https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome</a>. html, or at no charge from
Trimble at www.trimble.com/planningsoftware.html.</p>
<p>The POS/MV calibration should be performed in an open area where unrestricted
maneuvering is possible and there are few vertical features likely to produce
multipath signals. Set the user multipath setting to “Low” to allow the system
to calibrate with the highest accuracy. It is important for heading accuracy to
settle to less than the threshold set under the GAMS Installation Parameters
before performing a calibration.</p>
<p>Note: This threshold shall always be set to 0.5 degrees or less when calibrating
systems for OCS survey operations. Maneuvering the vessel in a figure eight
pattern will help bring the heading accuracy within this range. Once a
calibration is started, it often takes more than the 1-2 minutes on a straight
course stated in the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide for the “CAL in
Progress” process to complete. After a successful calibration, save the new
calibration values into non-volatile memory as described in the POS/MV
Installation and Operation Guide, and save a copy of the final POS/MV
configuration file for reference. A method for computing the lever arm offsets
is outlined in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-1-1-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.1.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h5>
<p>Once a high-quality POS/MV calibration has been performed, it should remain
valid until system components are moved or altered. The POS/MV should operate
reliably provided adequate satellite coverage and differential correctors are
available. If the POS/MV becomes problematic, recalibration may be conducted at
the discretion of the field unit. If a recalibration is desired, the same
process used for the annual calibration should be repeated. Note: If the POS/MV
is recalibrated, a new patch test should be performed for any associated
multibeam echosounder systems. (Refer to section 1.5.5.1.2 for a description of
the patch test).</p>
<p>For each calibration conducted, system settings, procedures, and results
achieved should be recorded in a POS/ MV Calibration Report. A blank report form
is included in Appendix 1 (POS-MV_Cal_Report.pdf), with sample data entered in
red font. This documentation shall be maintained by the field unit and available
for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. The
dates of current POS/MV calibrations shall be reported in the Hydrographic
Systems Inventory. All POS/MV calibrations conducted shall be described in the
DAPR for each applicable project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-2-sound-speed-measurement-instruments">1.5.2 Sound Speed Measurement Instruments</h3>
<p>Accurate measurements of sound speed (often referred to as “sound velocity”)
both through the water column and at the water’s surface are critical to
hydrography, particularly if soundings are acquired using a multibeam
echosounder. Two basic types of sound speed instruments are currently used by
NOAA hydrographic field units, those which directly measure sound speed
(commonly referred to as “velocimeters”) and those which measure conductivity,
temperature and depth and then calculate sound speed (commonly referred to as
“CTDs”). All field units performing OCS surveys shall proactively monitor the
accuracy of sound speed measuring instruments and conduct preventative
maintenance as described below.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-2-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<p>All sound speed measuring instruments employed by NOAA hydrographic field units
shall be calibrated annually and inspected by the manufacturer, unless the
manufacturer recommends a different time period. Field units should turn in all
sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED depot promptly after
arriving for winter inport or during another suitable period of inactivity. EED
will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the manufacturer for
calibration and inspection. This process takes approximately six weeks.</p>
<p>Note: For DigibarPro systems, only the probe needs to be returned for annual
calibration. There is no need to remove the cable or display unit from the
vessel unless these components require repair or replacement. Field units that
can not feasibly submit sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED
depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer.
Following annual calibrations, comparisons equivalent to the Data Quality
Assurance processes described in section 1.5.2.2 shall be conducted for all
sound speed measuring instruments.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-2-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Periodic quality assurance checks shall be performed for all sound speed
measuring instruments. NOAA hydrographic platforms shall conduct these quality
assurance checks on a daily or weekly basis as described below. Field units with
sound speed measurement instruments not addressed in this manual should contact
the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to develop a comparable quality
assurance plan.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-2-2-1-daily-data-quality-assurance-daily-dqa-">1.5.2.2.1 Daily Data Quality Assurance (Daily DQA)</h5>
<p>If the vessel is equipped with a surface sound speed measuring instrument
(typically installed at the head of a multibeam sonar), compare a measurement
from this instrument to the results of a full sound speed profile acquired at
the beginning of each day the surface instrument will be used. This comparison
can be performed in NOAA’s Velocipy software, which is a second generation of
the Velocwin, using the “Surface Sound Speed DQA” function. All discrepancies
greater than 1 m/s should be noted and tracked to determine if the instrument
requires repairs or recalibration. Note: NOAA hydrographic field units have
experienced several failures with this type of instrument. Since surface sound
speed data is critical for acquiring data with flat-faced MBES systems, these
instruments must be monitored and tested each day prior to operations.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-2-2-2-regular-data-quality-assurance-regular-dqa-">1.5.2.2.2 Regular Data Quality Assurance (Regular DQA)</h5>
<p>A full water column profile from each sound speed profiling instrument shall be
compared to an independent source at least once during each leg of survey
operations or every two weeks during survey operations This comparison should be
accomplished by conducting a simultaneous cast with two profiling instruments
and comparing the results using Velocipy’s “Compare Two Profiles” function.
Caution: If simultaneous casts are processed in Velocipy using the same vessel
name, the processed file names will be identical and one will be overwritten.
The user should rename the first file processed to avoid this potential problem.
Data from two different types of profilers can be used for this comparison,
provided both datasets have been initially processed in Velocipy. Comparison
casts should be conducted in water at least as deep as typical depths for the
current project. Note: If a Digibar is to be used for a simultaneous cast, first
conduct a Velocipy “Digibar DQA” comparison for the instrument using a fresh
water sample.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-2-3-general-maintenance-practices">1.5.2.3 General Maintenance Practices</h4>
<p>Velocimeters and CTDs should be rinsed with freshwater at the end of the day
after use. The moving parts of the winch on the Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP)
system requires weekly lubrication of its moving parts (e.g. gears and
levelwind) to maintain effectiveness and to sustain its lifetime. It is also
highly recommended to shift the messenger on the MVP every 24 hours of
continuous use however armoring may make this more tedious. Field units should
routinely do an inspection of the MVP towfish.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-2-4-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.2.4 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Results from annual sound speed instrument calibrations, i.e., manufacturer’s
documentation and the corresponding digital calibration coefficient file, shall
be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic
Systems Reviews or at the request of OCS. The dates of annual calibrations and
any instrument problems or nonroutine maintenance performed shall be reported in
the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. If using Velocipy, the results of each DQA
test performed will be sorted by project number and saved to a file named
&lt;project number&gt;.DQA, (e.g., OPR-A###-AA-YY.DQA) in the “SVfiles”
directory. If Velocipy is not used for weekly data quality assessments, these
comparisons shall be manually recorded. DQA records associated with each survey
shall be included in Separates II of the Descriptive Report. Documentation for
all calibrations or maintenance conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each
applicable project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-3-manual-depth-measurement-equipment">1.5.3 Manual Depth Measurement Equipment</h3>
<p>Although no longer used as a primary means of survey, lead lines and sounding
poles are invaluable for some operations. These tools can be used to take
soundings in areas too shallow for echosounders or to verify least depths over
dangers to navigation or shoals. The most common use of lead lines is as a
calibration standard for echosounders. However, like all measuring devices,
these tools have their own calibration requirements. Both lead line and sounding
pole requirements are addressed in this section.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-3-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.3.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<h5 id="1-5-3-1-1-lead-lines">1.5.3.1.1 Lead Lines</h5>
<p>All field units engaged in hydrographic surveys where general depths are less
than 40 meters shall carry one or more marked and calibrated lead lines.
Depending on the depths in which they will be used and the size of the vessel,
OCS recommends that lead lines are 30m to 60m long. Each lead line shall be
marked with a numerical identifier to be retained throughout the life of the
lead line or until re-marking is necessary.</p>
<p>Traditional lead line material is mahogany-colored tiller rope with a phosphor-
bronze wire center. Specifications for this material and directions for making
and maintaining a traditional lead line can be found in Appendix 1
(Leadline_Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since line and tape materials have evolved
significantly and lead lines are now used in special circumstances, rather than
for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for alternate materials to be used
when constructing a lead line. When choosing a lead line material, key
properties to be considered are strength and elasticity. The line or tape must
not part if deployed from a vessel underway and must not stretch significantly
under tension or when wet.</p>
<p>All lead lines used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated to at least
the decimeter level. Any convenient system of marking that will minimize reading
errors may be used, provided each whole meter of line is marked and identified
with a clearly written numerical depth value.</p>
<p>Lead lines shall be calibrated by comparison with a known standard during Annual
Systems Preparation and prior to each day’s use if constructed with non-
traditional material. The testing standard should be a survey quality metal
tape, pre-measured graduation marks on deck or ashore, or similar item. If the
mean correction exceeds 0.1m the lead line must be re-marked.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-3-1-2-sounding-poles">1.5.3.1.2 Sounding Poles</h5>
<p>When surveying in depths too shallow for an echosounder, it may be prudent to
use a sounding pole if the area is flat and the waters are protected. Sounding
poles shall not be used in depths greater than 4 meters and are typically not
used in depths greater than 2 meters.</p>
<p>A traditional sounding pole is made from a meter length of 1.5 inch (3.81 cm)
round lumber capped with a weighted metal shoe at each end to hasten sinking.
Shorter poles may be used, depending on the depth conditions. Directions for
making and maintaining a traditional sounding pole can be found in Appendix 1
(Leadline_ Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since modern pole, pipe, and stick
materials are readily available and sounding poles are now used in special
circumstances, rather than for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for
alternate materials to be used when constructing a sounding pole. When choosing
a sounding pole material, key properties to be considered are strength, weight,
and bluntness. The pole must not significantly bend if deployed from a vessel
underway or weaken when wet. Additionally, it must not be so buoyant or sink so
rapidly that it becomes difficult to handle and must not penetrate the seafloor
to an extent that would generate erroneous soundings. All sounding poles used
for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated in meters to at least the
decimeter level. Any convenient system of marking that will minimize reading
errors may be used.</p>
<p>Any sounding pole maintained aboard a NOAA hydrographic vessel shall be
calibrated during Annual Systems Preparation. Calibration shall be against a
known standard, such as a survey quality metal tape, to ensure that depth
markings are unambiguous and accurate. Sounding poles created between Annual
Systems Preparation events shall be calibrated prior to use on an OCS
hydrographic survey.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-3-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.3.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Due to the static nature and infrequent use of manual depth measurement
equipment, there are no requirements for accuracy checks, other than annual
calibrations, if traditional lead lines or a regularly maintained sounding pole
is being used. As previously stated, lead lines constructed with non-traditional
material shall be calibrated prior to each day’s use, and sounding poles created
on-the-fly for special circumstances encountered shall be calibrated prior to
use on any OCS hydrographic survey.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-3-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.3.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>A Lead Line and Sounding Pole Calibration Report shall be completed each time a
lead line or sounding pole is made or compared to a standard. A report form is
provided in Appendix 1 (Leadline_SndngPole_Cal_Report.pdf), with sample data in
red font. Reports for calibrations conducted during Annual Systems Preparation
shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during
Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of</p>
<p>OCS. The dates of current calibrations shall be reported in the Hydrographic
Systems Inventory. Documentation for calibrations shall be included in the DAPR
for each applicable project.</p>
<p>In addition to the above reporting requirements, a full Sounding System
Comparison shall be completed each year as a part of Annual Systems Preparation,
following calibration of all sounding systems. A lead line shall be used to
manually acquire a standard for comparison to calculated depths from each of the
field unit’s vertical beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and diver least
depth gauges. This process shall be documented according to the example provided
in Appendix 1 (Sndng_Sys_Comparison_Log.pdf) and included in the DAPR for each
applicable project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-4-vertical-beam-echosounder-vbes-systems">1.5.4 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES) Systems</h3>
<p>NOAA hydrographic field units may use VBES systems for water depth measurement
and/or to confirm depths measured by other systems, such as multibeam
echosounders. The consistency and accuracy of VBES soundings are directly
related to the care with which these instruments are calibrated, maintained, and
operated. It is critical that field units both ensure these systems are properly
calibrated and educate operators about the effects of manually adjusting the
transceiver controls such as power, gain, and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Vertical beam echosounders are typically either dual frequency or single
frequency. Users should operate each echosounder in accordance with its
manufacturer’s documentation. When used for OCS hydrographic surveys, VBES
systems shall be set with an assumed speed of sound through water of 1500 m/s.
Recorded sounding data shall be corrected for actual sound speed, determined
with a sound speed profiling instrument, during data post-processing.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-4-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.4.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<p>The field unit shall verify, during Annual Systems Preparation, that VBES
sounding data are accurate and that each system is in proper working order.
While a lead line comparison is the minimum VBES calibration requirement, a
simultaneous comparison of lead line, VBES, multibeam echosounder, and diver
least depth gauge (DLDG) data is also required by OCS during Annual Systems
Preparation. (Refer to section 1.5.3.3 for details on Sounding System
Comparison.) If the VBES unit is found to be out of calibration, it should be
sent to the regional EED depot, which will return it to the manufacturer for
repair. Field units that can not feasibly submit VBES systems to the regional
EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the
manufacturer. When performing sounding system comparisons, the vessel should,
ideally, be anchored in an area with a flat sandy bottom and calm sea
conditions. If comparisons will also be made to DLDG data, the water depth
should be between 10 and 20 meters. The lead line depth should be measured from
a location close to the transducer and timed as near as possible to slack water
to minimize any effect from current on the lead line. If the vessel has a known
list or is large enough that a level platform can not be accurately determined,
simultaneous lead line readings should be taken from each side of the vessel and
averaged.</p>
<h6 id="1-5-4-1-0-1-hypack-latency-test">1.5.4.1.0.1 HYPACK Latency Test</h6>
<p>The following HYPACK latency test procedures should be performed for vessels

<h4 id="1-5-4-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.4.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>For modern digital VBES systems, instrument errors are generally small, fixed in
magnitude, and independent observed depths. However, to ensure that echosounders
continue to operate properly, periodic confidence checks should be conducted. A
confidence check can be accomplished by comparing VBES soundings to lead line
readings, nadir multibeam echosounder depths, or DLDG data. As when performing a
calibration, routine comparisons should be conducted in an area with a
relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions are calm.</p>
<p>Confidence checks shall be conducted at least once per week for all surveys
performed with VBES systems. Any discrepancies identified between sounding
systems that are greater than the allowable depth error for the corresponding
survey must be investigated to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-4-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.4.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Results of VBES calibrations and confidence checks shall be recorded in a
Sounding System Comparison Log to be maintained by the field unit. A comparison
log is included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.pdf) with sample data in
red font. Calibration records for each VBES used for hydrographic surveying
shall be available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the
request of OCS. Sounding System Comparison Logs shall be included in the DAPR
for all applicable surveys.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-5-multibeam-echosounder-mbes-systems">1.5.5 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) Systems</h3>
<p>NOAA’s hydrographic survey units use MBES systems to acquire full- and partial-
bottom bathymetric coverage throughout a survey area, to determine least depths
over critical items such as wrecks, obstructions, and dangers-to-navigation, and
for general object detection. Field personnel should refer to section 5.2 of the
HSSD. Proper calibration of MBES systems is critical for maintaining a high level
of accuracy and meeting OCS hydrographic survey specifications. Various models
of swath-type multibeam sonars are used for NOAA hydrographic survey operations.
For the purposes of this document these MBES systems will be treated as
equivalent units unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-5-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.5.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<p>MBES performance is largely a function of the original system specifications. To
ensure that MBES systems used for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately,
all systems should be maintained and serviced in accordance with manufacturers
specifications.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-5-1-1-offset-measurement-and-verification">1.5.5.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification</h5>
<p>Offsets for MBES systems shall be measured and/or verified as part of the vessel
static offsets survey described in section 1.4.1. OCS typically uses two types
of MBES configurations, hull-mounted and pole- or lever mounted. Particular
attention must be paid to the alignment of the sonar head with respect to the
keel of the survey vessel, as a very small alignment error can introduce
significant positioning errors in the data.</p>
<p>In addition to the above alignment considerations, pole- and lever-mounted
systems introduce another potential source of positioning error. Since these
systems are deployed and retrieved after each use, care must be taken to insure
that the sonar is both stabilized during use (via pins, guy wires, or the like)
and that its deployed position does not vary. Stabilizing mechanisms should be
inspected regularly for wear, stretching or general deterioration that could
affect the sonar offsets or stability.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-5-1-2-mbes-calibration">1.5.5.1.2 MBES Calibration</h5>
<p>As part of Annual Systems Preparation, field parties shall conduct a system
calibration to quantify the accuracy, precision, and alignment for each MBES
system. At a minimum, the calibration shall include determination of residual
biases in roll, pitch, heading, and navigation timing error. This procedure,
commonly referred to as a “patch test”, is performed by acquiring data that will
highlight only one bias parameter at a time. The patch test should be conducted
in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of the HSSD.</p>
<p>Generally two lines of data must be acquired to resolve each bias. Vessel speed,
direction and/or seafloor slope will be specified for each line. Figure 1.5
illustrates the most efficient line plan for conducting a patch test; however,
lines for each bias may be completed in separate areas if an ideal geographical
location is unavailable. Once patch test data has been acquired, system
integration errors are determined by aligning slopes and targets acquired from
different directions and speeds.</p>
<p><strong>(image)</strong></p>
<p>Figure 1.5: Most efficient line plan for MBES calibration testing</p>
<p>Once bias correctors are determined for a system, the appropriate values should
be entered into the CARIS HVF for the corresponding vessel. If problems become
apparent in the data or any part of the echosounder system configuration is
changed or damaged, a new system calibration must be conducted.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-5-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.5.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>MBES confidence checks shall be performed in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of
the HSSD. Confidence checks shall be performed at least once during each survey
conducted by multiple vessels that acquire overlapping data. Surveys conducted
with only a single vessel, shall perform confidence checks at least once per
week. A confidence check can be accomplished by comparing nadir MBES values to
lead line readings, VBES depths, or DLDG data. These comparisons should be
conducted in an area with a relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions
are calm. Any discrepancies identified between sounding systems that are greater
than the allowable depth error for the corresponding survey must be investigated
to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-5-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.5.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Each patch test conducted shall be documented in a MBES Calibration Table. A
copy of this table is provided in Appendix 1 (MBES_Cal_Table.pdf) with sample
data entered in red font. In addition to a MBES Calibration Table, a chartlet
showing the test area and line plan, with line numbers and headings clearly
identified, shall be created for each system tested. The exact format of these
chartlets is left to the discretion of the hydrographer. Calibration information
shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during
Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of patch test
documentation shall be submitted with the DAPR for each applicable project.</p>
<p>Results of each MBES confidence check shall be recorded in a Sounding System
Comparison Log to be maintained by the field unit. A comparison example is
included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.pdf) with sample data in red font.
Sounding System Comparison Logs shall be included in DAPR for all applicable
projects.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-6-diver-least-depth-gauge-dldg-">1.5.6 Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG)</h3>
<p>The DLDG is a portable, self-contained, diver-deployed instrument that measures
pressure in absolute pounds per square inch (PSIA). Least depth values are
computed from the difference between surface pressure (pre-dive) and the
pressure observed by the diver at a feature’s least depth.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-6-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.6.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<p>Each DLDG used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be calibrated annually. These
instruments should be submitted to the regional EED depot promptly after
arriving for winter inport or during another suitable period of inactivity. EED
will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the manufacturer for
calibration and inspection. Field units that cannot feasibly submit DLDGs to the
regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the
manufacturer.</p>
<p>Once the DLDG calibration report has been received, a copy must be forwarded to
HSTP. HSTP personnel will generate, and provide to the field unit, a digital
corrector file that must be loaded into Velocipy software to facilitate DLDG
pressure data processing. After calibration, a Sounding System Comparison
including depths computed using the DLDG shall be performed and recorded
according to the example provided in Appendix 1 (Sndng_Sys_Comparison.pdf).</p>
<h4 id="1-5-6-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.6.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Velocipy software includes a DLDG DQA utility, which compares the DLDG pressure
measurement in air to barometric pressure. This comparison routine should be
performed daily to record a relationship between the vessel’s barometer and the
DLDG. The DLDG DQA should also be performed before and after each day’s dive
operations to provide a pre-dive and post-dive record. If inconsistencies
between the barometer and calculated DLDG pressure become apparent, the DLDG may
require repair or recalibration. The DLDG DQA routine in Velocipy generates a
graphic display of the DLDG pressure with respect to acceptable error margins.
The test passes if the new DLDG data point (red dot) lies within the two dashed
lines representing the acceptable error boundaries. Prior Daily DQA results are
also displayed on this graph for comparison. Each time a Daily DQA is performed,
the data are appended to a digital file DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-6-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.6.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>The manufacturer’s DLDG calibration report, HSTP generated digital corrector
file, and results of the post calibration Sounding System Comparison shall be
maintained by the field unit and available for review during annual Hydrographic
Systems Review and at the request of OCS. The DAILYDQA.DAT file and reports for
any additional Sounding System Comparisons shall be included in the DAPR for
each applicable project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-7-side-scan-sonar-sss-systems">1.5.7 Side Scan Sonar (SSS) Systems</h3>
<p>NOAA hydrographic survey units use side scan sonar systems for both object
detection and object recognition. Side scan sonar is typically used in
conjunction with a VBES or MBES system to meet object detection coverage
specifications for OCS surveys. Any SSS system used for OCS hydrography must be
capable of detecting an object on the sea floor with minimum dimensions of 1 m x
1 m x 1 m, as stated in section 6.1.2.1 of the HSSD.</p>
<p>OCS uses both hull mounted and towed SSS system configurations. Horizontal
accuracy for SSS operations will depend on the system configuration,
investigation technique, water depth, and target density. However, the position
of targets identified with side scan imagery must be sufficiently accurate to
relocate the item for least depth and survey position determinations, usually
via a MBES system. In general, side scan imagery should be capable of
positioning point features to an absolute accuracy of less than 10 meters. NOAA
field units use various models of side scan sonar for hydrographic survey
operations. For the purposes of this document, these systems will be treated as
equivalent unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-7-1-calibration-requirements-and-methods">1.5.7.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods</h4>
<p>Side scan sonar object detection and classification performance is largely a
function of the original system specifications. To ensure that side scan sonar
systems used for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately, hydrographers shall
return all side scan systems to the regional EED depot for annual inspection and
maintenance. If a towfish is equipped with a pressure sensor, this must be
serviced and calibrated as part of the EED annual maintenance. If a towfish has
been equipped with a transponder for locating the system if lost, new lithium
batteries shall be installed and the system tested using an interrogator as part
of annual maintenance.</p>
<h5 id="1-5-7-1-1-offset-measurement-and-verification">1.5.7.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification</h5>
<p>Side scan system offsets must be measured and/or verified prior to performing a
calibration. Depending upon whether the sonar configuration is hull-mounted or
towed, requirements for offset measurements will vary. Offset requirements for
each type of configuration are described below.</p>
<h6 id="1-5-7-1-1-1-hull-mounted-sss-configuration">1.5.7.1.1.1 Hull-Mounted SSS Configuration</h6>
<p>For hull-mounted configurations, the phase center of the side scan shall be
precisely positioned during the vessel static offsets survey. The phase center
of the towfish is considered to be at the fore and aft midpoint of the
transducers and on the centerline in the athwartships and vertical axes.</p>
<p>When hull-mounting a SSS, particular attention must be paid to the alignment of
the towfish with respect to the keel of the survey vessel, as a very small
alignment error can introduce significant positioning errors in the data. For
example, a heading alignment error of only 1° will add 1.75 m horizontal
positioning error at the edge of the swath on a 100-m range scale. In extreme
cases, it may be necessary to measure alignment error with a yaw patch test, and
enter a correction in the HVF. The field unit should contact the regional HSTP
Field Support Liaison for assistance with this test, if needed.</p>
<h6 id="1-5-7-1-1-2-towed-sss-configuration">1.5.7.1.1.2 Towed SSS Configuration</h6>
<p>For towed SSS operations, static vessel offsets should be measured to the
towpoint. The actual towfish position is typically calculated using towfish
depth and cable out measurements. Towfish depth may be determined by a depth
sensor installed in the towfish or calculated by subtracting the towfish height
(determined by a separate echosounder installed in the towfish or the first
return of each sonar ping) from the depth of water (determined from a vessel
echosounder). If a SSS is equipped with a pressure sensor, its accuracy should
be tested annually and whenever the horizontal positioning accuracy of side scan
targets is in doubt. Cable out can be estimated visually from calibrated
markings on the cable or measured with an electronic cable counter. Each
configuration is described below.</p>
<p>Note: When measuring cable out, the cable zero mark is not at its connection to
the towfish, but at the phase center of the sonar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marked Cable - Marked tow cables shall be measured using a survey grade metal
tape and clearly marked. Cable markings shall be in meters and enable visual
interpolation to a tenth of a meter. Since a cable jacketcan stretch and slide
over the conductors during use, cable measurement markings shall be verified
annually, and whenever the hydrographer believes they may be in error.</p>
</li><li><p>Cable Counter - Electronic cable counters shall be configured according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The hydrographer shall verify the accuracy of the
cable counter by comparing manual and electronic cable measurements at a range
of cable lengths. This check shall be conducted annually, whenever the counter,
cable, or sheave configuration is changed, and whenever the hydrographer
believes there may be a cable measurement error. Note: For some cable counters,
the serial data output being logged may be in different units than what is shown
on the cable counter display. In such cases, the hydrographer may need to
perform a conversion on raw cable out data either prior to logging or during
post-processing.</p>
</li></ul>
<h5 id="1-5-7-1-2-sss-calibration">1.5.7.1.2 SSS Calibration</h5>
<p>As part of Annual Systems Preparation, the field unit shall demonstrate that all
side scan sonar systems to be used for OCS hydrographic surveys are capable of
meeting object detection standards set forth in section 6.1.2 of the HSSD. An
operational SSS Calibration Test shall be conducted to demonstrate the system’s
ability to detect and accurately position seafloor targets across the system’s
range on both sonar channels. Test information shall be recorded in a SSS
Calibration Table. An example of this table is provided in Appendix 1
(SSS_Cal_Table.pdf) with sample data entered in red font.</p>
<p>The SSS Calibration test shall consist of a minimum of 10 side scan passes on a
target approximately 1 m x 1 m x 1 m. The target shall be imaged from a variety
of ranges and directions, with survey speed, water depth, and weather
representative of typical survey conditions. Although dedicated test targets can
be used for this check, targets of opportunity, such as buoy blocks, lobster
pots, and appropriately sized rocks, may be sufficient. The hydrographer should
use alternate systems (e.g., MBES) to determine a high accuracy absolute
position of the target for comparison with SSS detected positions.</p>
<p>Figure 1.6 shows the OCS recommended line plan for conducting a SSS Calibration
Test. Note that this line plan balances ensonifications on the port and
starboard channels, across the range scale, from different target aspects, and
from different directions. This approach assists the hydrographer in
differentiating systematic and random errors in detection and positioning.</p>
<p><strong>(image)</strong></p>
<p>Figure 1.6: Recommended line plan for SSS calibration testing.</p>
<p>Test data shall be processed according to standard OCS hydrographic survey
procedures and evaluated to identify any systematic problems with the sonar or
vessel offsets. If the contact is not detected in more than one of the 10
passes, the SSS towfish should be carefully inspected for damage and the system
re-tested. If detection remains problematic, the field unit shall contact EED
and the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance. Successful object
detections shall be used to compare the mean detected position with the absolute
target position and to compute the approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the
system. This radius should not exceed 5 meters for hull-mounted systems and 10
meters for towed systems. Several methods can be used to estimate the 95%
Confidence Radius. A simple option is to plot the detected target positions in
MapInfo, and use the “Compute Statistics” function to compute the sample
standard deviation of the x and y components of the detection positions
(computing statistics of the Eastings and Northings yields values in meters).
Assuming a normal distribution, 95% of the samples will fall within 1.96
standard deviations of the mean. If the distribution of detections is similar in
x and y, the 95% Confidence Radius is roughly 1.96 times the square root of the
sum of the squares of the standard deviation of detected positions in x and y.</p>
<p>If the distributions in x and y are not similar, it is likely that a systematic
bias exists that was not canceled by ensonifying the target from multiple ranges
and directions.</p>
<p>Similar results can be obtained by measuring the error for each detection (the
distance from the absolute target position to the detected position) and
computing the sample mean and standard deviation of the errors. The approximate
95% Confidence Radius is then the sample mean plus 1.96 times the standard
deviation.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-7-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.7.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>At least one confidence check of a SSS system shall be conducted each day the
system is used for data acquisition. These checks should be in accordance with
section 6.1.3.1 of the HSSD and consist of detecting a discrete object at the
outer range scale limits for each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard).
Confidence checks shall be annotated in the daily data acquisition records. If
these confidence checks repeatedly show discrepancies with expected performance,
a new System Calibration may need to be performed.</p>
<p>Before surveying with a SSS system that has been either reconfigured or in
storage, a “rub test” should be performed. The rub test is a simple procedure
wherein a hydrographer observes the SSS trace while an assistant physically rubs
one transducer on the towfish and then the other while the system is pinging. As
the assistant rubs the transducer, the hydrographer should see a return on the
corresponding channel of the imagery. A rub test failure can indicate system
errors such as incorrect gain or power settings, a faulty cable, or damaged
transducers. This test should be conducted while the towfish is out of the water
and dry, to avoid the possibility of electric shock. Caution: Do not leave a SSS
towfish turned on for more than 5 minutes while out of the water. These are
watercooled systems and can be damaged by excessive heat buildup if left on when
not deployed.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-7-3-documentation-reporting-requirements">1.5.7.3 Documentation &amp; Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>In addition to a SSS Calibration Table, a chartlet showing the test area, actual
target position, test line plan, positions of successful detections, and
approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the target location shall be created for
each system tested. The exact format of these chartlets is left to the
discretion of the hydrographer. This information shall be maintained by the
field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at
the request of OCS. Documentation for SSS Calibration Tests conducted shall be
included with the DAPR for each associated project.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to individually document and report SSS confidence
checks required in section 1.5.7.2 above. Hydrographers shall verify that these
checks were conducted, describe the results, and discuss any problems
encountered in the Quality Control section of each applicable Descriptive
Report.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-8-tide-gauges">1.5.8 Tide Gauges</h3>
<p>Tide gauges are used to measure water levels for calculating bathymetric data
correctors. In any given tidal area, water level data account for the largest
vertical correction to soundings. However, water levels vary due to both
astronomical tides and effects from other forces such as wind, rain, barometric
pressure, and freshwater runoff. Even in areas where tidal range is small, such
as the Gulf of Mexico, the total water level variations can still be large
enough to significantly affect sounding accuracy. If water level values are not
properly measured and applied, then hydrographic error budget requirements may
not be met.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-8-1-calibration-requirements-methods">1.5.8.1 Calibration Requirements &amp; Methods</h4>
<p>Tide gauges, batteries, GOES antennas, battery cables, regulators, and other
tide gauge equipment are typically maintained and calibrated (if necessary) by
the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) staff on
an annual basis. Field units should contact the local Operations Branch of the
CO-OPS Field Operations Division immediately after the close of the field season
to arrange for servicing of any gauges deployed with the unit. As the field unit
prepares for the upcoming field season, the unit should discuss tide gauge
requirements with FOD as soon as project assignments are known.</p>
<p>Field units should thoroughly test all tide gauge equipment, including that
serviced by CO-OPS, as part of the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review
process.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-8-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.8.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>When a field unit installs a tide gauge for hydrographic surveys, it is
responsible for operation and maintenance of that gauge for the duration of the
survey. As such, it behooves the hydrographer to conduct a full functional check
of all gauge equipment immediately prior to installation. Once the gauge is
installed, the following checks should be conducted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hydrographer should monitor the daily Hydro Hotlist email to ensure that
gauge data are being received by CO-OPS and pass quality checks. (Note: the
hydrographer must specifically request CO-OPS to add gauges to the Hydro
Hotlist. See section 3.5.2.3.1 on page 86 for additional information.)</p>
</li><li><p>If GOES transmissions are not possible from the tide station site, the
hydrographer should visit the station every few days to ensure that data are
being recorded. The hydrographer should download recorded data on these visits,
check the water levels to ensure a smooth curve consistent with predictions (if
available), and transmit the data to CO-OPS.</p>
</li><li><p>Regardless of the status of the satellite uplink, the hydrographer should
visit the station site approximately weekly to check the physical integrity of
the installation. These checks should include the following:</p>
</li><li><p>Confirm that gas pressure is adequate to last until the next visit, and check
for gas leaks at tubing connections (for bubbler gauges).</p>
</li><li><p>Check battery voltage to confirm that the solar cells are providing adequate
charging current.</p>
</li><li><p>Check for physical stability of the gauge by performing a minimum of 2 hour of
staff readings for comparison with recorded data.</p>
</li><li><p>These station checks are particularly critical immediately before and after an
extended absence from the survey area (such as a port call).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If problems are observed with water level data an on-site assessment should be
conducted and field units should contact CO-OPS to determine the preferred
course of action.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-8-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.8.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Since tide gauge equipment is maintained by CO-OPS, annual field unit
calibrations are not required. Tide gauges do not need to be addressed during
Hydrographic Systems Reviews aside from being listed in the Hardware Systems
Inventory. Any tide gauge problems encountered during survey operations shall be
described, including any subsequent effects to survey data, in applicable DAPRs
or DRs.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-9-leveling-equipment">1.5.9 Leveling Equipment</h3>
<p>Geodetic leveling equipment is used to measure elevation differences between
benchmark locations and to extend vertical control from established benchmarks
to water level measuring equipment or a water level staff. For hydrographic
survey operations, this equipment consists of a compensator leveling instrument
and level rod. The quality of the vertical datum measured is partially dependent
on the quality of the leveling performed between benchmarks and the water level
staff or equipment. It is important to properly maintain leveling instruments
and rods to ensure that they are within calibration tolerances.</p>
<p>It is OCS policy to follow the standards and procedures established by CO-OPS
for calibrating and operating leveling equipment used to survey water level
stations. These requirements are described in the NOS User’s Guide for the
Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations,
published by CO-OPS and included on the Hydrosoft website. These requirements
are summarized here, but the hydrographer should refer to the User’s Guide for
specific information on leveling operations.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-9-1-calibration-requirements-methods">1.5.9.1 Calibration Requirements &amp; Methods</h4>
<p>For OCS hydrographic survey operations, level surveys shall be conducted to at
least third order accuracy standards. The minimum scale calibration standard for
level rods being used for third order surveys is the manufacturer’s standard.
Level rods do not have a recommended time period between scale calibrations. If
an error is suspected in a rod scale, the rod may be calibrated and certified by
an approved laboratory.</p>
<p>No leveling instrument is perfectly aligned. The angle from which the line of
sight departs from the actual level surface when the instrument is leveled is
referred to as collimation error. To minimize collimation error, the leveling
instrument shall be serviced and adjusted during Annual Systems Preparation and
whenever a collimation error cannot be reduced to acceptable tolerances in the
field. This service shall be performed by a qualified, manufacturer-approved
technician.</p>
<p>The hydrographer shall verify the collimation of leveling instruments after
annual calibration. Collimation shall be checked according to either of the two
approved methods described in section 3 of the User’s Guide. The collimation
error should be no greater than ± 0.05 mm/m. If it exceeds this tolerance, the
level instrument must be adjusted and another check performed. Collimation
Checks shall be processed and documented on NOAA Form 75-29 (or an equivalent)
according to the procedure and example in section 3 of the User’s Guide.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-9-2-periodic-quality-assurance-checks">1.5.9.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Collimation and general performance of leveling equipment shall be verified
prior to each leveling survey by repeating the collimation check. If collimation
error exceeds ± 0.05 mm/m, the level instrument must be adjusted and another
check made until the error can be successfully reduced below this threshold.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-9-3-documentation-and-reporting-requirements">1.5.9.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Collimation check and calibration records for leveling equipment used for OCS
hydrographic surveys shall be maintained by the field unit and available for

equipment and dates of calibration shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems
Inventory. Documentation for any subsequent collimation checks and/or
calibrations conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable
project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-10-horizontal-vertical-control-equipment">1.5.10 Horizontal &amp; Vertical Control Equipment</h3>
<p>No standard calibration requirements have been implemented at this time for
horizontal and vertical control equipment. This equipment&#39;s calibration
requirements and quality assurance checks should be maintained per the
manufacturer’s recommendations until further guidance is provided.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-10-1-documentation-reporting-requirements">1.5.10.1 Documentation &amp; Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>Note: Calibration and quality assurance documentation for horizontal and

and at the request of OCS. Horizontal and vertical control equipment and dates
of calibration (if applicable) shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems
Inventory. Documentation for any subsequent calibrations or quality assurance
checks conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-11-reference-surface">1.5.11 Reference Surface</h3>
<p>Once all sonar and ancillary instrument calibrations have been performed, field
parties shall assess the combined effects of vessel offsets, patch test biases,
and sonar bottom detection for each vessel-sounder combination by comparing data
and grids over a known reference surface. This is a capstone of the system
preparation process, as it combines the data from all constituent systems for an
assessment of the final result.</p>
<p>In the event there is only one vessel and sensor, a comparison should be made
with another field unit or data from previous years if possible. If there is no
previous coverage readily available, a self-comparison of reference surfaces
shall be conducted. Self-comparisons cannot be used to check for overall
vertical biases, but are useful for checking for other data anomalies.</p>
<p>Note: this section assumes testing of multibeam echsounders. However, testing
vertical beam echosounder systems over a multibeam reference surface can also
provide useful results.</p>
<p>Field units are encouraged to collaborate in establishing and using reference
surfaces. Ideally, these would be located in an area to which field units could
return annually or as needed, with all datasets centrally archived for future
comparison.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-11-1-reference-surface-acquisition-and-processing">1.5.11.1 Reference Surface Acquisition and Processing</h4>
<p>A grid pattern (shown in Figure 1.7) should be acquired with each sonar-vessel
combination for a robust comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The grid should be planned over a relatively flat area of depth appropriate
for the sonar under evaluation. (It may be helpful if the test area includes a
few discrete features such as wrecks or rocks, but this is not required.)</p>
</li><li><p>Survey lines should be planned for at least 100% coverage in each direction,
leading to ~200% coverage over the entire grid.</p>
</li><li><p>The reference surface should be sized to produce a minimum of approximately
five million soundings per echosounder head. This is necessary to provide a
statistically significant sample size for each beam of the sonar. Larger
surfaces will typically improve analysis results, but obviously at the expense
of acquisition and processing time.</p>
</li><li><p>Sonars should be operated (vessel speed, system settings) as they would
ordinarily be for standard survey operations in the area.</p>
</li><li><p>Settings (beam type-EA/ED, power, gain, pulse width, absorption, spreading)
should be the same for the comparative systems, but may differ for different
frequencies of the same sonar. For example, for the Reson7125, the 200kHz may
have settings that differ from the 400kHz system.</p>
</li><li><p>All necessary data correctors such as delayed heave, tide, sound speed, and
TPU shall be acquired and applied to the data. Incorporating the techniques of
Ellipsoidally-Referenced Surveys (ERS), in addition to traditional tides, can
help minimize errors associated with water levels.</p>
</li><li><p>Backscatter data should be acquired concurrent with bathymetry data.</p>
</li><li><p>Ideally, all of a field unit’s sonar-vessel combinations should be tested in
reasonably quick succession to limit influence of environmental changes.</p>
<p><strong>(image)</strong></p>
<p>Figure 1.7 – Sample reference surface acquisition plan. A 200% coverage scheme
was employed over a site which displayed a mixture of flat bottom, sand waves,
and targets (buoy blocks).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Once gross fliers have been removed, the data for each unique vessel/sonar
combination should be gridded using CUBE at the highest resolution at which the
dataset can support a minimum of five soundings per node (ideally, twice the
maximum standard required survey resolution for the depth of the test area, i.e.
2.5% water depth). In addition, the backscatter should be mosaicked at
appropriate resolution. A number of tests are now advised, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visually check each surface for any data artifacts, especially those
associated with offset issues, poor patch test values, timing errors, or
incorrect motion stabilization application.</p>
</li><li><p>Assess the computed total propagated uncertainty and standard deviation of
each reference surface, comparing these uncertainty estimates to IHO thresholds.</p>
</li><li><p>Compute difference surfaces to compare the surfaces of different vessel/sonar
combinations acquired at roughly the same time (consider performing these
differences with data referenced to both tidal and ellipsoidal reference
frames). Compare the difference values with the estimated uncertainty for each
of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds. (This tests inter-system
agreement).</p>
</li><li><p>Compute difference surfaces to compare each vessel/sonar combination with
results from the same combination from previous years (again, consider
performing these differences with data referenced to both tidal and ellipsoidal
reference frames). Compare the difference values with the estimated uncertainty
for each of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds.</p>
</li><li><p>Perform a beam-by-beam statistical comparison of the processed soundings
against the reference grid composed of the same data. The HIPS beam-by-beam
analysis tool may be the most appropriate method. Examine results for beam-
specific biases or noise. (This tests internal-consistency of the sonar, and
helps identify faulty segments of the transducer or beamformer).</p>
</li><li><p>As an alternative or in addition to the beam-by-beam comparison, two separate
surfaces at lower resolution (one from each 100% coverage) can be created, and
differenced. (This will help assess internal consistency of the data, but will
not highlight problem segments of a sonar swath).</p>
</li><li><p>Backscatter analysis is more qualitative, but assessments may include visual
assessment of the mosaic for any obvious artifacts which could be
associated with a sonar malfunction, inter-system comparison, and year-to-
year comparison of backscatter acquired with the same sonar vessel system.</p>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="1-5-11-2-periodic-qualify-assurance-checks">1.5.11.2 Periodic Qualify Assurance Checks</h4>
<p>Reference surfaces and associated data analysis should be performed as part of
any new sonar-vessel system commissioning, and at least annually as part of the
Hydrographic System Readiness Review. Additional tests may be advisable after
significant changes to the sonar-vessel system, or if any data qualify concerns
emerge from standard survey data.</p>
<h4 id="1-5-11-3-reporting-requirements">1.5.11.3 Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>As the reference surface test is a capstone of the overall Hydrographic System
Readiness Review (HSRR) Process, any results which indicate concerns in the
overall health of the sonar-vessel system(s) shall be discussed in the HSRR
Memo.</p>
<p>A fuller description of reference surface process and results shall be included
in the DAPR as an attachment. The exact format is left to the discretion of the
hydrographer, but it should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Description of the reference surface area in sufficient detail to allow other
units to utilize the same location</p>
</li><li><p>A full description of the system combination tested</p>
</li><li><p>A brief description of data acquisition and processing, including discussion
of any problems encountered or non-standard procedures followed</p>
</li><li><p>Results and discussion of the comparison tests performed</p>
</li><li><p>Any recommendations</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The following is an example discussion of Reference Surfaces from NOAA Ship
Rainier: As an example, part of the Rainier’s HSRR process involves creating
nine reference surfaces for the purposes of calibrating their four survey
launches (with their nine associated transducers).” One sonar is arbitrarily
declared the “baseline”, and all surfaces are then differenced from this
baseline (Figure 1.8). Once these differences are known, statistics are
generated, visualized and appropriately interpreted (Figure 1.9). In the example
shown in Figure 1.9 all three sonars mounted to Launch 2803 (green) exhibited a
6-7cm bias as compared to the other vessels (when referenced to MLLW); a bias
that was mitigated when comparisons were instead made on the ellipse. This
knowledge then informs the HSRR team to examine the parameters of Launch 2803
that are unique to the MLLW workflow (i.e. Dynamic Draft, Static Draft, Loading,
Tides or Heave). In this case, it was an erroneous dynamic draft model due to
the characteristics of the suspended 8125 sonar unique to the design of Launch</p>
<ol>
<li>Once analysis is complete, all the systems could then be condensed into a
master reference surface which can be used as the baseline in future HSRRs.</li></ol>

<h2 id="1-6-software-systems">1.6 Software Systems</h2>
<p>Computer software plays an essential role in NOAA’s hydrographic surveying
operations and must be managed with care and attention to detail. It is
important that each field unit ensure during the Annual Systems Preparation,
that their systems are up-to-date with the most current approved versions of
survey related software. Field units shall operate with the most up-to-date
software available; any mid-season software changes should be carefully
documented so that the field unit can revert to a prior software version if
problems arise. OCS has established the following basic guidelines for
maintaining, updating and testing software.</p>
<p>All field units should incorporate adequate computer and software maintenance
periods into their annual schedules. This should be planned to coincide with a
period of relatively low operational activity, typically winter inport for
ships. Field units should use this opportunity to install and configure software
on new computer systems and conduct comprehensive rebuilds of systems to be
retained. In general, “rebuilding” a system entails the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Back-up all storage devices attached to the system (local hard drives).</p>
</li><li><p>Reformat storage devices.</p>
</li><li><p>Complete any scheduled hardware upgrades (new drives, memory, etc.).</p>
</li><li><p>Load the latest approved version of the operating system and mission software
(standardized to the greatest extent possible across the platform).</p>
</li><li><p>Restore only essential data from the back-up.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>This practice has been particularly useful on Microsoft Windows-based systems
with multiple users, as it enforces software and configuration standardization
and limits retention of unnecessary data or software that may adversely affect
system performance.</p>
<p>NOAA personnel seeking information on hydrographic software updates should
consult HSTP. HSTP is the first point of contact for most commercial
hydrographic software packages in use by NOAA hydrographic field units and is
directly responsible for writing and maintaining many of the in-house programs
used for OCS surveys. Prior to installing software upgrades, it should be
ascertained that the new version or update has been tested and approved for use.
The field unit’s regional HSTP Field Support Liaison should be able to answer
questions about software availability and testing.</p>
<p>Aboard NOAA hydrographic survey ships, EED shares responsibility for maintenance
of hydrographic survey computer systems and software. Traditionally, EED has
maintained computer hardware, operating systems, and data acquisition software,
while OCS has been responsible for survey planning and data processing software,
but these lines are often blurred. Shipboard hydrographers should, therefore,
coordinate all software requests and changes with the embarked Electronics
Technician, as well as with HSTP.</p>
<p>There will be cases where a critical software problem warrants installation of
an upgrade before HSTP or EED has rigorously tested and/or verified its
functionality. Hydrographers are encouraged and expected to exercise common
sense in these cases. If external testing is not possible, field units should
establish an internal software test program, document the procedures and
results, and report their findings to HSTP and EED, so other units can benefit
from their experience.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-1-types-of-software-systems">1.6.1 Types of Software Systems</h3>
<h4 id="1-6-1-1-computer-operating-systems-oss-">1.6.1.1 Computer Operating Systems (OSS)</h4>
<p>The operating system is a computer’s most fundamental software and it affects
the performance of all other programs running on a machine. Typically, NOAA’s
hydrographic survey computer systems use the Microsoft Windows environment. New
versions or significant updates (such as Service Packs) for any OS should not be
installed until the hydrographer has consulted both EED and HSTP. These groups
must confirm that mission critical software has been successfully tested under
the proposed new OS version prior to installation on any system used for
hydrographic survey operations. OCS discourages major mid-season OS upgrades
(for example, switching from Windows XP to Windows 7 ) and suggests that field
units attempt to maintain a standard OS on all data acquisition and processing
systems.</p>
<p>OCS will not notify field units of available OS upgrades unless the update is
critical to maintain functionality or compatibility with hydrographic systems.
However, most OS vendors have an automatic notification system for critical
updates. Field units with Internet access can also check the OS vendors’
websites to determine if updates are available. Complete OS upgrades should be
acquired through EED (if shipboard) or via the field unit’s chain of command.</p>

<p>Table 1.1: Common OCS Data Acquisition Software Packages.</p>
<p>OCS recommends that data acquisition software updates be performed during Annual
Systems Preparation. Field units wishing to install updates during normal
operational periods shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to
determine if the new version has been successfully tested in a controlled
environment. Occasionally, it may be necessary to install a critical update
without prior HSTP testing. In such cases, field units should first document the
existing software version settings so that it can be reinstalled if the update
causes more severe problems. The software upgrade should then be installed on a
limited basis to minimize the effects of any bugs encountered. Proper testing of
new software may require several days of standard field operations to fully
assess its functionality. Field units should process and thoroughly examine
resulting data for errors prior to making a unit-wide installation.</p>
<p>HSTP maintains support agreements with most manufacturers of data acquisition
software packages used by OCS. Although some companies may contact individual
licensees directly when updates are available, this communication is typically
routed through HSTP or EED. When a period of relative inactivity suitable for
computer system maintenance is approaching, field units should contact the
regional HSTP Field Support Liaison and assigned EED Electronics Technician (if
applicable) for any approved data acquisition software upgrades that are
available.</p>
<h4 id="1-6-1-3-data-processing-software">1.6.1.3 Data Processing Software</h4>
<p>Data processing software are those programs used to manipulate and analyze

<p>Table 1.2: Common OCS Data Processing Software Packages</p>
<p>HSTP maintains software support agreements with most data processing software
manufacturers, many of which notify users directly when new updates are
available. The following update procedures for specific processing software
packages have been established by OCS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CARIS products: All NOAA hydrographic field units should be receiving weekly
email from CARIS describing any new releases. Any field units not
subscribed to this service should contact the regional HSTP Field Support
Liaison to register.</p>
</li><li><p>HSTP products (Pydro, Hydro_MI, Velocipy): HSTP will notify field units
directly when critical updates are available.</p>
</li><li><p>IVS 3D: Units interested in receiving email notification of Fledermaus updates
can subscribe to the IVS email list. See
<a href="http://www.qps.nl/display/fledermaus/support">http://www.qps.nl/display/fledermaus/support</a> for more information.</p>
</li><li><p>MapInfo: All MapInfo licenses are covered under a global maintenance plan
managed by HSTP. HSTP will notify field units directly when critical MapInfo
updates or patches are available.</p>
</li><li><p>POSPac: HSTP will notify field units directly when critical updates become
available.</p>
</li><li><p>OPUS: OPUS is not available as a standalone program, but can be found online
at <a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/</a> OPUS/</p>
</li><li><p>NGS INVERSE3D; NGS INVERSE3D can be used to perform the weekly position
uncertainty check base stations and can be downloaded at
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html</a>.</p>
</li><li><p>VDatum: VDatum software is developed jointly by the NOS Tri-Office VDatum
Team. VDatum transformations utilize a combination of stepwise transformations
between ellipsoidal, orthometric, and tidal datums, leveraging the best
available hydrodynamic models and historical tidal and geodetic data at each
step. VDatum software can be downloaded at <a href="http://vdatum.noaa.gov/">http://vdatum.noaa.gov/</a>.</p>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="1-6-1-4-support-software">1.6.1.4 Support Software</h4>
<p>Support software includes any packages that are used as part of the hydrographic
survey process, but do not directly interact with data. However, they may be
used to create digital products that accompany survey data and, as such, must be
compatible with systems throughout OCS. Examples of support software that may be
in use by a field unit include NOAA Chart Reprojector, Paint Shop Pro or
AutoCAD.</p>
<p>Although OCS does not notify field units of upgrades to these packages unless
there is a pressing operational need, most vendors provide email update
notification to registered users. Field units should coordinate with OCS to
ensure that support software is in compliance with NOAA standards and compatible
with survey systems.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-2-software-repositories">1.6.2 Software Repositories</h3>
<p>Once a field unit has determined that a software upgrade is approved, available,
and desirable, the digital files must be acquired. While some vendors will
provide these upgrades on physical media, users are often expected to download
updates via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or from Internet websites. HSTP posts
both commercial and in-house software upgrades to OCS’s anonymous FTP server (IP
address 205.156.4.84). Note: NOAA field units can not upload data to the FTP
server.</p>
<p>If field units are outfitted with reliable high speed Internet access, software
can be easily downloaded from vendor sites or the FTP server. However, some of
NOAA’s hydrographic field units have limited bandwidth for accessing the
Internet or for receiving email attachments; thus, an alternate means of
obtaining software upgrades may be necessary. Field units should consider other
connection sites, such as public libraries or Internet cafés, or contact the
regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to have updates mailed on CD or other media.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-3-documentation-reporting-requirements">1.6.3 Documentation &amp; Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p>Each computer used to acquire or manipulate hydrographic survey data shall be
included on the Software Inventory portion of the Hydrographic Systems
Inventory. Installations and updates for primary software packages shall be
recorded for each computer, as shown by the sample data (red font) included on
the Software Inventory spreadsheet. Additionally, a record of system settings
for hydrographic data acquisition software shall be created and updated
throughout the field season. If a software system has the capability to output a
file identifying all configuration settings, a copy of this file will meet
system settings reporting requirements. Otherwise, the field unit will need to
manually generate a digital record (e.g., a spreadsheet). Software documentation
shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during
Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. A copy of the Software
Inventory and system settings records in effect during operations shall be
included in the DAPR for each respective project.</p>
<h2 id="1-7-personnel-rosters">1.7 Personnel Rosters</h2>
<p>People are the most essential component of any hydrographic survey system, and
training hydrographic personnel is a critical element of survey preparation for
any field unit. Even if all hardware and software systems are functioning
correctly, data quality and operational efficiency will suffer without properly
qualified hydrographers. Guidelines for training and qualification of
hydrographic personnel are described below.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this manual, “hydrographic personnel” are defined as those
members of a field unit’s complement (permanent or temporary duty) whose normal
duties include responsibility for any activities that directly affect survey
planning, data acquisition, or data processing. In addition to Physical
Scientists, Survey Technicians, Commissioned Officers, and others in immediate
control of survey operations, this includes launch coxswains and Officers of the
Deck (OODs) responsible for operating vessels during surveying; visitors who
participate in data acquisition and processing without direct supervision; and
the unit’s command. Support personnel, such as marine engineers, stewards, and
members of the deck department not acting as launch coxswains, are not typically
considered “hydrographic personnel”. However, if survey operations will be
significantly impacted by any of the aforementioned groups, e.g. an insufficient
number of engineers to perform planned 24-hour operations, these situations
should be mentioned in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo described in
section 1.1.1 .</p>
<h3 id="1-7-1-personnel-qualifications-training">1.7.1 Personnel Qualifications &amp; Training</h3>
<p>Standard hydrographic training and qualification requirements are not currently
established for NOAA’s hydrographic personnel. Therefore, it is incumbent on
each field unit to establish internal standards to ensure that hydrographic
personnel are adequately qualified to safely and efficiently accomplish the
unit’s mission. Such a program of training and qualification can be crafted from
any of several available components including, but not limited to, the
following:</p>
<h4 id="1-7-1-1-internal-training-and-qualification-standards">1.7.1.1 Internal Training and Qualification Standards</h4>
<p>These are standards of training and qualification developed by the field unit to
meet the particular needs of its configuration and mission. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch Hydrographer-in-Charge (HIC) workbook and qualification</li><li>Launch Person-in-Charge (PIC) workbook and qualification</li><li>Launch Coxswain workbook and qualification</li><li>Officer Of the Deck (OOD) workbook and qualification</li></ul>
<h4 id="1-7-1-2-noaa-hydrographic-training">1.7.1.2 NOAA Hydrographic Training</h4>
<p>The Office of Coast Survey organizes an annual basic hydrographic training
program (“Hydrotraining”). One session per year is offered at a location on each
coast, typically Norfolk, VA and Seattle, WA, and all new survey personnel are
encouraged to attend. Subject to demand and available funding, sessions on
advanced topics suitable for hydrographers with more than one year of experience
may also be offered in conjunction with the basic course.</p>
<p>CO-OPS is available to provide training on basic tidal theory, tide gauge
installation, discrete tide zoning and TCARI methodology. Elements of these
topics are covered in basic Hydrotraining, but field units may choose to
schedule additional training with CO-OPS to meet their specific needs.</p>
<h4 id="1-7-1-3-external-training">1.7.1.3 External Training</h4>
<p>Hydrographers may be eligible to pursue hydrographic qualifications from an
outside agency or organization such as the American Congress on Surveying and
Mapping (ACSM).</p>
<h3 id="1-7-2-reporting-requirements">1.7.2 Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p>Although the Hydrographic Systems Inventory includes only a basic roster of
hydrographic personnel, deficiencies in either numbers or qualification of
personnel should be noted in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo described
in section 1.1.1</p>
<p>Additionally, OCS recommends that each field unit maintain a record of personnel
training and qualifications. Formally documenting personnel training and
qualifications will assist Chiefs-of-Party in assessing the readiness of their
personnel. This record can also help identify hydrographic training needs,
enabling units to request and allocate resources accordingly. Copies of
curriculum and/or requirements for any internally crafted qualification or
training should be maintained by the field unit for reference purposes.</p>
<h2 id="1-8-data-storage-availability">1.8 Data Storage Availability</h2>
<p>An inventory of all available data storage shall be completed and documented as
part of the HSRR.</p>
