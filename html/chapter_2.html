<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h1 id="pre-survey-planning">Pre-Survey Planning</h1>
<p>Pre-survey planning is essential for any field unit to effectively and
efficiently conduct hydrographic survey operations. When planning operations,
the hydrographer must keep in mind the assigned survey specifications and
approved methods for meeting those criteria. This Chapter describes information
that will be provided to a field unit when a hydrographic survey is assigned and
provides project preparation and survey planning guidance.</p>
<h2 id="2-1-crew-vessel-safety">2.1 Crew &amp; Vessel Safety</h2>
<p>Above all, every member of the field party should understand that safety of the
crew and vessel is the number one priority. Safety shall be the foremost
consideration in all aspects of Office of Coast Survey (OCS hydrographic
surveys, from the planning stages through data submission. It is the
responsibility of the Chief-of-Party, as well as vessel crew, to be aware of
safety hazards and take steps necessary to ensure undue risks are avoided, even
if it means ceasing operations.</p>
<p>Good planning and information can minimize risks associated with hydrographic
surveying. Recommended practices to increase safety include, but are not limited
to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use historical weather information to prepare for seasonal patterns.</p>
</li><li><p>Review the survey region for exposed areas, constricted areas, shallow areas,
surf, etc. Plan on surveying challenging areas when weather, tides, and currents
are optimal.</p>
</li><li><p>Review prior survey Descriptive Reports (DR) and smooth sheets for uncharted
hazards. Often, the DR will describe deficiencies, hazards, and challenges from
prior surveys and field experience.</p>
</li><li><p>Work progressively from safe water towards unknown, shallow, or potentially
hazardous areas.</p>
</li><li><p>Use daily survey information progressively in the field to minimize hazards.
Communicate survey and safety information to all personnel involved in
operations.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Read the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) features
included with the project files descriptions to understand hazards and survey
the feature project area safely.</p>
<p>Understand the limitations of charted and source information and approach
features conservatively during initial operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-2-the-project-cd-dvd">2.2 The Project CD/DVD</h2>
<p>When a hydrographic survey is assigned, the HSD Operations Branch (OPS), or the
NSD Navigation Response Branch (NRB) if the unit is an NRT, will generate and
compile relevant project information onto a Project CD/ DVD. This information
will include project instructions, as well as supporting information and data
files to be used during field operations and subsequent survey processing.
Copies of the Project CD/DVD will be disseminated to the appropriate field unit
six weeks prior to the start of the project. The file structure illustrated in
Figure 2.1 represents that of a typical Project CD/DVD. If a folder is
intentionally left empty, the project planner will place in a readme.txt file
indicating as such.</p>
<p><strong>(image)</strong></p>
<p>Figure 2.1: Project DVD Structure</p>
<h3 id="2-2-1-hydrographic-survey-project-instructions">2.2.1 Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions</h3>
<p>The Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions will identify specific requirements
for a survey project. Project Instructions will be included on the Project
CD/DVD and can be equated to a Requirements Document or Statement of Work. Field
units shall acknowledge receipt of Project Instructions via email to the
assigned OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-2-supporting-project-information">2.2.2 Supporting Project Information</h3>
<p>Extensive supporting project information will be provided on the Project CD/DVD.
The following items are included: Consults folder containing relevant project
correspondence, project GIS Files, Junction Surveys, Prior Surveys, and
preliminary tidal zoning files. The naming conventions for project information
files generated at OPS or NRB will reference the applicable project number or
survey sheet number.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-1-consults">2.2.2.1 Consults</h4>
<p>OCS, as a unit of a federal agency, has responsibilities under section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA, 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) to take
into account the effects of its undertakings on historic properties. The process
for federal agencies in complying with the NHPA is laid out in 36 C.F.R. Part
800, which prescribes consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO). In addition, OCS may consult with other NOAA offices or governmental
agencies, depending on jurisdiction. The Hydrographic Surveys Division is
responsible for conducting the entire consultation process. Correspondence and
documentation relating to consultations with these Historic Preservation Points
of Contact (HPPOCs) will be included in the Consults folder as background
information for the field units.</p>
<p>Any additional relevant project correspondence will be included in this folder.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-2-gis-files">2.2.2.2 GIS Files</h4>
<p>This folder will include the Composite Source File, MapInfo Sheet Limits,
Maritime Boundary Point(s) Document, the Project Reference File, and Aids to
Navigation Records.</p>
<p>The OPS Project Manager or NRB Technical Assistant will compile all available
shoreline source files into one “composite source” file (CSF) in S-57 .000
format. Shoreline source files include: ENC, RNC, Geographic Cells (GCs – also
labeled as DCFF ), and Lidar files. Compilation will include reviewing the CSF
to determine which shoreline features shall be verified by the field unit.
Features requiring verification shall have the attribute Assignment (asgnmt)
populated with “Assigned”.</p>
<p>The MapInfo sheets .tab will be provided to identify the planned area of
hydrography for each project. Layouts for Field Examinations (FEs) will vary
according to the item, feature, or area to be surveyed. Any MapInfo tables
created by the OPS Project Manager or NRB Technical Assistant will be projected
in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) using the North American Datum of 1983
(NAD83).</p>
<p>A Project Reference File (PRF) will also be delivered with the CSF. The PRF is
an S-57 attributed dataset containing reference layers such as survey limits,
junctions, recommended bottom sample locations and features which are
specifically targeted for investigation such as AWOIS points or Maritime
Boundary points.</p>
<p>The project wide AWOIS items are assigned to the field unit for investigation by
the OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant. This subset of the
master AWOIS database will contain all items falling within the limits of the
particular project, as well as any critical items in close proximity to the
survey area. AWOIS items are represented as placeholders by the S-57 Feature
Object CRANES. The AWOIS radii are represented by the S-57 Feature Object
ACHBRT. The AWOIS search radii are assigned based upon extensive research of
historical documents and factors such as the original source of the feature and
the quality of that feature’s positioning.</p>
<p>Prescribed investigation requirements for each AWOIS item will be specified in
the NOAA Extended Attributes (see section 8.2 of HSSD for details).</p>
<p>All AWOIS items included in the project area are “assigned” for verification
(asgnmt = “Assigned”). In addition, the project planner may “assign” AWOIS items
outside of the project area.</p>
<p>There are two types of AWOIS verification:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>AWOIS items which have not been verified in the past (Item Status =
“Assigned”, Search Type = “Full” or “Limited”) – investigation includes
verifying or disproving the item by covering the entire search radius regardless
of location with respect to survey limits.</p>
</li><li><p>AWOIS items which have been verified in prior surveys (Item Status =
“Completed”, Search Type = “Information”) – no search radius is required.
Investigation includes verifying or disproving the feature just as any other
feature within the project area is verified or disproved. A search outside of
the survey limits is not required (i.e. items inshore of the NALL).</p>
</li></ol>
<p>See section 7.3 of the HSSD for further information on AWOIS items.</p>
<p>If shoreline verification is not required, there will be no CSF however all
projects will contain a PRF containing a minimum of the survey limits.</p>
<p>NOAA’s Update Service Branch (USB) within the Marine Chart Division will review
NOAA’s Critical Corrections Database (CRIT) and/or USCG Integrated Aids to
Navigation Information System (IATONIS) database to identify ATONs within the
survey area that require positioning. Records for each assigned ATON will be
provided by USB for inclusion on the Project CD/DVD. ATON records will include
the current database position for each assigned ATON, position accuracies or
positioning methods that were used (if available), and any special positioning
requirements.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-3-junction-surveys">2.2.2.3 Junction Surveys</h4>
<p>Assigned surveys may include a junction with contemporary data from a recent
field season and all field units are required to ensure continuity in survey
coverage and depth by evaluating junctioning or overlapping surveys. The Project
Instructions will indicate if a junctioning survey is in a projection and datum
other than UTM NAD83 and requires a datum conversion or reprojection.</p>
<h5 id="2-2-2-3-1-junctioning-with-light-detection-and-ranging-lidar-surveys">2.2.2.3.1 Junctioning with Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) Surveys</h5>
<p>Lidar junction data will be provided in S-57 (.000 or .HOB) format on the
Project CD/DVD. Features found by the Lidar survey will be added to the
Composite Source File (CSF) as an existing feature. Lidar investigations will be
added to the Project Reference File (PRF). Field units should obtain the
required coverage type to the Lidar extent line or the Navigation Area Limit
Line (NALL), whichever is further offshore. The standard practice for coverage
overlap between Lidar and MB surveys is to overlap one swath width inshore of
the LGL. Verify or disprove all Lidar investigation items seaward of the NALL.</p>
<p>The following files will be included on the Project CD/DVD for junctioning with
Lidar data.</p>

<h4 id="2-2-2-4-prior-surveys">2.2.2.4 Prior Surveys</h4>
<p>The Project CD/DVD will include the Descriptive Report raster images of the
smooth sheet, features and soundings (in .000 format) for all available prior
surveys in the assigned area.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-5-survey-request-information">2.2.2.5 Survey Request Information</h4>
<p>The OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical Assistant will include, if
available, copies of documents from the maritime community, research groups, or
other entity requesting the survey on the Project CD/DVD.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-6-tides">2.2.2.6 Tides</h4>
<p>The Project CD/DVD will identify vertical control requirements for a project.
Vertical Requirements which are further explained in sections 2.4.4 &amp; 3.5.2 ,
could consist of traditional tidal zoning, TCARI, VDatum, constant separation
value, or ellipsoidally referenced zoned tides (ERZT). The Project Instructions
will explicitly list any required subordinate tide gauges. A VDatum or constant
separation file to correct soundings from the ellipsoid to chart datum will be
provided on the project CD/DVD. For ERS vertical datum QC procedures, refer to
chapter 9 of the HSSD.</p>
<p>The NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)
provides three basic types of water level data, “predicted tides,” “preliminary
water levels” and “verified water levels” referenced to MLLW or other
appropriate chart datum. All of this data can be downloaded from the CO-OPS
website. Typically, CO-OPS posts preliminary water level data within a few hours
of data acquisition. Stations included on the Hydro Hotlist (see section
3.5.2.3.1 are processed weekly and verified water level data is typically
available at the start of the following work week. Verified tides can be
downloaded from the CO-OPS Data Retrieval website:</p>
<p><a href="http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/text.html">http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/text.html</a></p>
<p>The CO-OPS Hydro Planning Team (HPT) also supplies discrete zoning or TCARI to
estimate water levels across the entire survey area where the water level
characteristics may vary from those where tide gauges are located. Historical
water level station information, including the location of each station site,
benchmark description and elevations, and historical datum references will also
be provided if historical tide stations need to be reoccupied.</p>
<p>Predicted tides using 6-min format will be supplied on the Project CD/DVD.</p>
<h4 id="2-2-2-7-orthoimagery">2.2.2.7 Orthoimagery</h4>
<p>The hydrographer may request orthoimagery for a project if considered necessary
to support pre-survey planning and post processing. Examples may (but are not
limited to) include areas where there are drastic differences from the shoreline
features in the CSF to the real world features. In these cases the hydrographer
should contact the project planner from HSD or NRB which is listed in the
project instructions to request approved orthoimagery. The project planner will
work with the HSD OPS Team Lead and RSD to acquire the approved orthoimagery if
available. Note: Orthoimagery is for reference only and shall not be used as
source for surveying (i.e. digitizing features from orthoimagery is not
allowed).</p>
<h2 id="2-3-additional-resources">2.3 Additional Resources</h2>
<p>Although the majority of information required to conduct an OCS hydrographic
survey will be provided on the Project CD/DVD, additional resources such as
training or reference materials may be necessary throughout a field unit’s
operating season.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-1-hydrosoft-website">2.3.1 Hydrosoft Website</h3>
<p>The Hydrosoft website, <a href="https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.html">https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.html</a>, is
maintained by OCS’s Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) and
provides an extensive amount of reference materials to the field. A Site
Download option will be made available at the beginning of each field season to
download the entire Hydrosoft website via a zip file. Additionally, the Recent
Updates page lists all the changes that have been made in reverse chronological
order.</p>
<p>The following types of materials can be found on the Hydrosoft Website:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Common survey software packages and applications, both commercial and in-house.</p>
</li><li><p>Software and hardware manuals and guides.</p>
</li><li><p>NOAA hydrographic training presentations and resources.</p>
</li><li><p>Nautical and navigation reference materials (e.g., Bowditch, Coast Pilot, Chart 1).</p>
</li><li><p>NOAA Hydrographic survey references (e.g., HSSD, FPM, IHO documents).</p>
</li></ul>
<h2 id="2-4-project-preparation">2.4 Project Preparation</h2>
<p>Once a field unit has received the Project CD/DVD, survey personnel should begin
preparatory tasks such as reviewing project information, establishing a data
management plan, contacting constituents, and planning horizontal and vertical
control if necessary. These tasks are typically performed on a project-wide
basis, prior to individual survey planning.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-1-project-information-and-instructions">2.4.1 Project Information and Instructions</h3>
<p>As soon as practicable, the field unit should inventory files provided on the
Project CD/DVD to verify that all necessary information has been included. Once
it has been confirmed that all files are present, project information should be
copied to the field unit’s computer systems in accordance with the unit’s
standard data management practices. The OPS Project Manager or the NRB Technical
Assistant will deliver draft Project Instructions approximately two months prior
to the start of a project. The Field Operations Officer and Chief Hydrographic
Surveyor should review the draft Project Instructions to raise questions and
concerns with HSD OPS or NRB at this time. Once the final Project Instructions
are delivered (approximately one month prior to the start of a project) all
appropriate hydrographers should review the Project Instructions and Project
CD/DVD files to become familiar with the project.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-2-data-management">2.4.2 Data Management</h3>
<p>Guidelines for effective field unit data management are described in the
following sections.</p>
<h4 id="2-4-2-1-digital-data-directory-structure">2.4.2.1 Digital Data Directory Structure</h4>
<p>Data directory structures used during acquisition and processing may vary among
field units. However, a standard should be in place within each field unit. It
is important to adhere to any field unit directory standards, as some software
configurations must reference specific directories. Refer to Appendix II for an
example of a field unit directory structure.</p>
<h4 id="2-4-2-2-digital-file-naming-conventions">2.4.2.2 Digital File Naming Conventions</h4>
<p>It is important to follow file naming standards within the field unit.
Maintaining these conventions greatly assists AHB and PHB in identifying data
records. Do not create data files with non-standard names that are unrelated to
the file content and will confuse others who must access that data.
Additionally, any preliminary, temporary, or extraneous files created by the
field unit should not be included with data submitted to AHB or PHB.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-3-horizontal-control">2.4.3 Horizontal Control</h3>
<p>Horizontal Control (HorCon) refers to the terrestrial network of geodetic marks
that support two-dimensional hydrographic positioning. Typically, NOAA field
parties use USCG differential beacons to correct GPS for hydrographic
positioning. USCG differential correctors are subjected to an internal quality
control process, ensuring a stable meter-level service. Additionally, USCG
differential beacons are precisely positioned; thus, it is generally unnecessary
for NOAA field units to establish horizontal control points when using this
positioning method.</p>
<p>In remote survey locations or confined areas such as a fjord, USCG differential
correctors may be unavailable or severely limited. For these areas, the field
unit shall establish at least one horizontal control point where a portable DGPS
control station can be installed. A review of the survey area should be combined
with local knowledge to determine a feasible location. Keep in mind that public
properties are usually preferred over private properties because special
permissions will typically not be necessary for future access. However,
equipment security must also be considered in populated areas which are easily
accessible. Security measures may include locking instruments, affixing owner
identification to equipment, and choosing a discrete station location. After a
suitable location has been chosen, the field unit should obtain permission to
access the property and install HorCon equipment. If it is necessary to drill
into rock during the installation, permits should be obtained for this purpose.
The Federal Aviation Administration’s Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) may
be used provided a QC procedure is followed as per Section 3.2.2 of the HSSDM.</p>
<p>HorCon techniques may also be used to determine high accuracy DGPS positions for
ATONs. If OCS’s Update Service Branch requires that an ATON be positioned using
high accuracy HorCon methods, specifications will be noted in the ATON
information provided on the Project CD/DVD. Typically, higher order ATON
positions will be required for range lights.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-4-vertical-control">2.4.4 Vertical Control</h3>
<p>Vertical control refers to a network of geodetic marks that supports three-
dimensional hydrographic positioning. Vertical control activities are typically
conducted to support water level gauge installations, water level measurements,
and ERS. Personnel from CO-OPS are responsible for all planning of tide and
water level requirements for OCS hydrographic surveys. CO-OPS will analyze
historical data and tidal characteristics for each project area, specify
operational NOS control stations, specify general locations for subordinate
water level stations to be installed, and provide the tidal zoning (both
preliminary and final) to be used during survey operations.</p>
<p>Installation, operation, and maintenance of controlling water level stations is
typically the responsibility of the CO-OPS Field Operations Division (FOD).
However, the hydrographic field unit may be required to install, monitor,
repair, and/or uninstall a control water level station under the instructions of
the CO-OPS FOD. The Project Instructions will state if installation, operation,
and/or removal of subordinate water level stations is required for a project. In
such cases, FOD will work in collaboration with the field unit to complete these
tasks. The field unit will be responsible for ellipsoidal positioning of
benchmarks near subordinate water level stations, in accordance with section
4.2.5 of the HSSD.</p>
<p>To prepare for vertical control operations, the field unit should verify that
all necessary equipment and tools have been obtained from CO-OPS. The following
manuals should occupy the equipment received from CO-OPS FOD:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Portable Tide Gauge Setup, Configuration, and Data Export Procedure</p>
</li><li><p>9210B Xlite Data Logger Operations and Maintenance Manual</p>
</li><li><p>Paros User’s Manual</p>
</li><li><p>Satlink2 Operations and Maintenance Manual</p>
</li><li><p>H-355 Pump User’s Manual</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A sample equipment checklist for water level station installations is included
in Appendix 2 (Wtr_Lvl_Statn_Equip_Checklist.pdf). Several reference guides are
available to assist the field unit with water level station procedures. For
reference, the following manuals can be found on the Hydrosoft website and can
also be downloaded from the CO-OPS website tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/pub.html</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NOS User’s Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations.</p>
</li><li><p>Specifications and Deliverables for Installation, Operation, and Removal of Water Level Station</p>
</li><li><p>CO-OPS User’s Guide for Electronic Levels</p>
</li><li><p>CO-OPS User’s Guide for Writing Bench Mark Descriptions</p>
</li><li><p>CO-OPS User’s Guide for GPS Observations</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Additionally, the field unit should review any subordinate water level station
locations specified in the Project Instructions and, if necessary based on local
knowledge, recommend alternate sites to CO-OPS. Keep in mind that public
properties are usually preferred over private properties because special
permissions will typically not be necessary for future access. However,
equipment security must also be considered in populated areas which are easily
accessible. Security measures may include locking instruments, affixing owner
identification to equipment, and choosing a discrete station location. Once
locations have been agreed upon, survey personnel should obtain permission to
access the property and install the staff, benchmarks, and gauge at the selected
site.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-5-constituent-contact">2.4.5 Constituent Contact</h3>
<p>The Project Instructions will list constituents who must be contacted at or near
the beginning and end of field operations to discuss survey objectives and
accomplishments. It is mandatory that the field unit contact the appropriate
regional NOAA Navigation Manager as identified in the Project Instructions.</p>
<p>The Project Instructions will also list various local contacts for reference.
These resources should not be overlooked and can often provide local knowledge
regarding AWOIS items, shoaling, marine activities, traffic patterns, and other
areas of concern. Local information sources include Port Authorities, Pilot
Associations, local ferry companies, fishermen, towing companies, U.S. Coast
Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and local and state government agencies.
Information regarding local survey requests or charting concerns that will not
be addressed during the current project should be conveyed to either the Chief
of Operations or the Chief of NRB.</p>
<h4 id="2-4-5-1-local-notice-to-mariners-announcement">2.4.5.1 Local Notice to Mariners Announcement</h4>
<p>Prior to commencing survey operations for a project, the field unit shall submit
an announcement to be included in the USCG Local Notice to Mariners (LNM). At a
minimum, this announcement should be submitted 2-weeks prior to commencing
operations and include information about the project work area, the type of work
being conducted, the field unit characteristics (e.g. size, color, markings of
ship and launches), means of contacting the field unit, and the start and end
dates of the survey. These announcements can be submitted via e-mail to the
appropriate USCG District e-mail, which are listed in the LNM for each district
(<a href="http://www.navcen.uscg">http://www.navcen.uscg</a>. gov/?pageName=lnmMain). See Appendix 2 for an example
of a LNM announcement.</p>
<h4 id="2-4-5-2-cultural-or-historic-submerged-features">2.4.5.2 Cultural or Historic Submerged Features</h4>
<p>HSD Operations Branch will contact the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO), historical/archaeological contact at NOAA’s Office of National Marine
Sanctuaries (ONMS), or other relevant governmental agency during preparation of
Project Instructions to request information on any historically significant man-
made features on the seabed within the survey area. Information provided by
these Historic Preservation Points of Contact (HPPOCs) will be included in the
Project Instructions. While the Project Instructions will also include contact
information, field units are generally not required to consult with the HPPOCs.
Instead, the Hydrographic Processing Branches are responsible for contacting the
HPPOCs in the event of discovery of a potentially historically significant
man made feature, in accordance with section 4.4.3 .</p>
<h4 id="2-4-5-3-potential-for-lost-or-damaged-fishing-gear">2.4.5.3 Potential for Lost or Damaged Fishing Gear</h4>
<p>In many areas, particularly the Northeast United States, field units may
encounter significant densities of fixed or floating fishing gear; such as
lobster pots, crab pots, fishing pots, long lines, gill nets, etc. NOAA field
units should always attempt to minimize the impact of hydrographic survey
operations on the commercial fishing industry. There is an expectation that
Coast Survey and all field units will make every effort to prevent damage or
interaction with fishing gear. However, if damage does occur, State agencies may
not detain or prosecute a Federal employee for violation of State law. For
example, it is a violation of Massachusetts law if someone destroys any lobster
or other fishing gear and can be punished through a fine or imprisonment;
however, if they are engaging in an activity authorized by the Federal law (e.g.
conducting survey operations), then they cannot be detained. See Appendix 2 for
a legal opinion from NOAA’s Office of General Counsel.</p>
<p>When operating in areas with high densities of fishing gear, field units should
consider modifying survey operations to reduce the possibility of damaging
fishing gear and survey equipment. Some steps that may be taken in areas of
dense fishing gear include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limiting survey operation to daylight hours.</p>
</li><li><p>Utilizing survey launches instead of the ship to conduct operations.</p>
</li><li><p>Utilizing hull-mounted sonar systems instead of towed survey gear.</p>
</li><li><p>Limiting use of towed sensors such as Moving Vessel Profilers</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In an effort to be pro-active and incorporate better coordination, the
Operations Branch will contact fishing and lobster associations and
organizations to inform them, prior to the field season, where a NOAA survey
vessel will be working and the approximate time frame. This notification will be
completed via an official letter to the association president or other point of
contact. The Navigation Manager for the region and field unit should be carbon
copied on this letter. See Appendix 2 for an example of a notification letter.</p>
<p>A mandatory point of contact will be listed in the Project Instructions for
projects which have the potential to significantly interfere with the work of
local fishermen/lobstermen. In those cases, the field unit must use that point
of contact to solicit input and coordinate with the local fishermen/lobstermen
in an effort to reduce possibility of fishing gear interaction and better plan
survey operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Navigation Manager or field unit will submit an announcement
of the survey project for inclusion in the USCG (LNM) as early as is practicable
(usually as soon as Project Instructions are received). See section 2.4.5.1 for
information on submitting announcements. These announcements should also be
provided directly to the fishing or lobstermen association for distribution to
their members and inclusion in their newsletters. Notices should not only be
sent to associations operating in the region the survey operations are being
conducted, but also adjacent associations, as they will likely have some
overlap.</p>
<p>While field units will make every effort not to cause damage or otherwise
interfere with fishing gear, some entanglements and other damage may occur. In
instances where fishing gear has been damaged local fisherman or lobstermen may
make a claim regarding lost or damaged fishing gear and request compensation.
The claims process for damaged fishing gear that may have been damaged by a NOAA
hydrographic survey field unit is listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Initial claims of gear interaction may be received from the fishermen by the
field unit, the USCG, or the State Marine Patrol. Claimants will typically be
referred to the State Marine Patrol as the best point of entry into the process.
Note that NOAA hydrographic survey field units are not authorized to collect
sworn statements, so whenever possible claimants should be referred to a law
enforcement agency.</p>
</li><li><p>State Marine Patrol and NMFS Office of Law Enforcement special agents will
collaborate to collect sworn statements from affected fishermen, depending on
whether alleged loss occurred in state or federal waters. At a minimum, claims
need to give the location of gear lost, estimate of when it was lost, what was
lost, and the fair market value.</p>
</li><li><p>All completed claims will be routed from NMFS OLE special agents to the
regional NOAA Navigation Manager.</p>
</li><li><p>The Navigation Manager will request route data from the field unit, and
compare the positions and times of the alleged loss with the unit’s activities.
The Navigation Manager may request assistance from the local NOAA Fisheries lab
to determine if fair market value claimed for lost gear is reasonable.</p>
</li><li><p>The Navigation Manager will forward substantiated claims to NOAA Office of
General Counsel for final certification and payment. See Appendix 2 for an
example letter for reimbursement. Unsubstantiated claims will be referred back
to the State Marine Patrol and NMFS OLE with supporting documentation.</p>
</li><li><p>OCS and OMAO leadership will determine how costs of any claims will be shared.</p>
</li></ol>
<h2 id="2-5-survey-planning">2.5 Survey Planning</h2>
<p>OCS recommends that systematic data acquisition plans be prepared prior to
vessel operations.These plans may consist of lines used directly for vessel
navigation, polygons used to designate survey areas if the acquisition software
provides a real time coverage map, or target files used to mark pre-determined
data acquisition points. When creating data acquisition plans, many factors must
be considered, including the scope of the survey, object detection criteria,
sheet layout with respect to surrounding features, available data acquisition
systems, number of features to be addressed, traffic patterns, local currents,
tide stages, and prevailing weather and sea conditions. Input from other survey
personnel, particularly those who have previously operated in the area, can be
invaluable when creating data acquisition plans. Proposed plans should be
reviewed by the FOO and/or Chief-of-Party prior to vessel operations.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-1-survey-scope">2.5.1 Survey Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of an OCS hydrographic survey will be categorized as basic
hydrographic, navigable area, field examination, or special project. Survey
requirements will vary according to this classification. The type of survey to
be conducted and any special requirements will be identified in the Project
Instructions.</p>
<p>The type of specific hydrographic survey projects are created via an evaluation
of known requirements and priorities. Survey limits are based on these
requirements and priorities as well as quantitative and qualitative measures of
shipping and boating in an area, the adequacy of existing survey information in
the area, the rate of change of the bathymetry, safety precautions and an
assessment/weighting of benefit versus efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-1-1-basic-hydrographic-surveys">2.5.1.1 Basic Hydrographic Surveys</h4>
<p>A basic hydrographic survey must be able to stand alone, without supplementation
by any other survey. The basic survey must be adequate to supersede all prior
surveys for charting purposes and meet all applicable survey requirements
specified in HSSD.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-1-2-navigable-area-surveys">2.5.1.2 Navigable Area Surveys</h4>
<p>Navigable area surveys must meet the requirements of basic hydrographic surveys,
but will have special survey limits defined in the Project Instructions.
Typically for this type of survey, the limits have been restricted to omit areas
that are not considered navigationally significant. Another scenario would be
restricting the survey to primary shipping traffic areas. Assigned survey limits
may require adjustment based on safety and field unit observations of local
traffic patterns. Any significant survey limit adjustments shall be coordinated
through the Chief of OPS.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-1-3-field-examinations">2.5.1.3 Field Examinations</h4>
<p>Field Examinations (FE) are item investigations or surveys that cover small
areas of specific interest. These surveys may be assigned to prove/disprove the
existence of reported dangers or obstructions, to provide data for harbor
development, or to supplement prior surveys for construction of large-scale
charts.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-1-4-special-projects">2.5.1.4 Special Projects</h4>
<p>Special Projects are surveys typically performed for purposes other than
creating nautical charts, such as habitat mapping, ocean exploration, or
homeland security. The Project Instructions will define requirements for Special
Projects.</p>
<p>Note: Depending upon the type of project, data acquired for Special Projects may
be subject to additional security measures. Any required security practices will
be defined in the Project Instructions. The field unit should use discretion
when handling Special Project data and contact the Chief of OPS or Chief of NRB
if data security requirements are in question.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-1-5-homeland-security-surveys">2.5.1.5 Homeland Security Surveys</h4>
<p>Homeland security surveys may be assigned in response to requests by the US
Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) for hydrography to support Homeland
Security in the nation’s coastal waterways. These projects are typically 200%
side scan sonar surveys conducted in accordance with NOS requirements for SSS
data acquisition and processing with minor modifications. Any additional project
specific requirements will be provided in the Project Instructions. In the event
that it is not possible to adhere to the HLS specifications, Chief, HSD
Operations Branch should be contacted for further guidance.</p>
<p>Special attention should be given to setting up survey plans and file structures
when a survey area contains a region to be submitted for Homeland Security
purposes. Careful advance planning will ensure that the relevant Homeland
Security survey data and associated ancillary files will be easily extractable
for submission to NAVOCEANO.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-2-object-detection-criteria">2.5.2 Object Detection Criteria</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by the Project Instructions, all data acquisition
shall be conducted to meet object detection criteria as set forth in the HSSD;
this may be accomplished with SSS, MBES, or a combination of the two. Object
detection capabilities are dependent upon the acoustical characteristics of the
sonar system. Vessel speed versus sonar pulse repetition rate (ping rate) must
also be considered in order to meet coverage requirements in the along track
direction. Standards set by OCS for object detection vary depending on sonar
technology and requirements for each sonar type are discussed individually
below.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-2-1-side-scan-sonar-sss-">2.5.2.1 Side Scan Sonar (SSS)</h4>
<p>The HSSD states that side scan sonar systems shall be operated such that a 1m x
1m x 1m object on the sea floor can be detected from acoustic shadow
measurements. OCS has determined that this object detection criteria can be met
by acquiring a minimum of 3 independent ensonifications (pings) per meter
traveled in the along-track direction. This criterion can be met by regulating
vessel speed based on sonar range scale. Longer operating ranges have slower
pulse repetition rates, thus requiring that the vessel speed be slower to meet
object detection requirements. Refer to sections sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 of the
HSSD for further guidance on side scan object detection standards. Sonar ping
rates should be defined in the operator’s manual or the manufacturer’s technical
documentation.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-2-2-multibeam-echosounder-mbes-">2.5.2.2 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES)</h4>
<p>Multibeam echosounder object detection criteria vary according to water depth.
Adequate detection has been defined by OCS as 3.2 beam footprints, center-to-
center, per 3 meters (in depths of 40 meters or less) or a distance equal to 10
percent of the depth (in depths greater than 40 meters). In the along track
direction, this criterion can be met by regulating vessel speed based on sonar
range scale, which directly affects ping rate. Since the size of MBES beam
footprints will be greater as the angle from nadir increases, object detection
capabilities should be calculated based on outer beams. Field personnel should
refer to section 5.2.2 of the HSSD for further guidance on multibeam object
detection standards. Sonar ping rates should be defined in the operator’s manual
or the manufacturer’s technical documentation.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-3-survey-line-planning">2.5.3 Survey Line Planning</h3>
<p>Before creating a line plan, the Project Instructions should be reviewed for any
required methodology, line spacing, or coverage requirements. Besides Project
Instruction requirements, factors such as general bathymetry, traffic patterns,
shoreline features, currents, prevailing weather and sea states, and distance
from GPS base stations should also be considered during line plan creation. New
features discovered during operations may warrant additional adjustments to line
plans as the survey progresses. It should be noted that survey limits are
subject to revision based upon command decision and/or requirements for safe
vessel operation. Any significant survey limit adjustments shall be coordinated
through the Chief of HSD Operations Branch.</p>
<p>Safety should never be compromised for the sole purpose of following a line
plan. Line plans used for data acquisition can be classified into the following
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mainscheme (MBES, SSS, or VBES)</p>
</li><li><p>Holidays (MBES, SSS or VBES)</p>
</li><li><p>Crosslines (MBES or VBES)</p>
</li><li><p>Developments (MBES or VBES)</p>
</li><li><p>Target Files</p>
</li><li><p>Special Circumstances</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Acquisition requirements vary depending upon data category and the type of
equipment used. OCS recommends that field units standardize survey line
numbering such that data classification can be determined based upon line
number. For example, use the 100 number series for the first 100% of side scan
sonar lines; the 200 number series for 200% side scan numbers; the 300 number
series for side scan holidays lines; the 400 - 500 number series for mainscheme
multibeam lines; the 600 - 800 number series for development data; and the 900
number series for crosslines. Specific line numbering standards have not been
implemented by OCS; however, standardization within each field unit is strongly
recommended.</p>
<p>Line plan requirements and guidelines for each data category are discussed in
the following sections. Keep in mind that these guidelines are provided to help
the field unit maximize survey efficiency, but they should not be followed at
the expense of personnel and vessel safety.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-3-1-mainscheme">2.5.3.1 Mainscheme</h4>
<p>Mainscheme refers to the primary survey data that are systematically acquired to
meet basic survey requirements. Mainscheme data are typically comprised of
complete or object detection MBES data or 200% SSS imagery data acquired
simultaneously with VBES bathymetry. However, in some circumstances variances
such as a combination of complete multibeam and 100% side scan data may be
preferred.</p>
<p>When planning mainscheme lines, special consideration should be given to
junction areas. For surveys that are part of the same current project and from
the same year, data overlap in junction areas shall be sufficient to ensure
continuous coverage. To adjoin with a non-contemporary survey from a different
year and possibly conducted by a different vessel, a 100-200 meter overlap of
mainscheme data is required, unless the Project Instructions and provided
project limits indicate otherwise.</p>
<h5 id="2-5-3-1-1-multibeam-echosounder-mbes-">2.5.3.1.1 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES)</h5>
<p>When planning mainscheme MBES lines, the hydrographer must consider object
detection requirements, echosounder system, and water depth. If complete
coverage is desired, line spacing will vary according to the effective swath
width. The available swath width will vary between systems, but object detection
requirements may require data filtering by swath angle or could even limit the
types of sonars which may be used. Generally, lines should be oriented parallel
to depth contours for consistent swath widths and line spacing. The following
formula can be used as a general rule of thumb for determining swath width:</p>
<p>Available Swath Width = 2 x Water Depth x (tangent 1/2 swath angle)</p>
<p>The hydrographer should keep in mind that allowing for adequate data overlap
when planning mainscheme lines can significantly reduce the number of holidays
created during acquisition. Based on the above formula and collective OCS
experience, mainscheme line spacing is commonly set at 3 x Water Depth to obtain
complete coverage.</p>
<p>In special cases, partial MBES coverage may be used for mainscheme survey data.
This type of coverage might be assigned if time is limited and existing survey
data are fairly modern. In such cases, required line spacing will be noted in
the Project Instructions. For further information on MBES requirements for OCS
surveys, see section 5.2.2 of the HSSD.</p>
<h5 id="2-5-3-1-2-side-scan-sonar-sss-">2.5.3.1.2 Side Scan Sonar (SSS)</h5>
<p>Typically, two-hundred percent coverage is required when using SSS as a
mainscheme survey technique. One hundred percent coverage is completed by
acquiring data that meet the assigned object detection requirements over the
entire survey area one time. This process is performed a second time to obtain
two-hundred percent coverage. Side scan sonar data quality will, inherently,
degrade both at nadir and at outer ranges. Because of this characteristic, line
plans for the second hundred percent should be either offset or oriented
differently than the first hundred percent. OCS recommends offsetting 200% lines
by ½ of the line spacing for the first 100% coverage. If possible, SSS data
should be acquired by running lines perpendicular to depth contours to avoid
imagery distortion caused by slopes in the athwartships direction.</p>
<p>Note: Multibeam backscatter imagery is not considered equivalent to, or a
replacement for, side scan sonar imagery. Side scan sonar provides low grazing-
angle imagery that enables identification of features not visible in lower
resolution, higher grazing angle MBES backscatter imagery.</p>
<p>The line spacing necessary to obtain 100% SSS coverage is dependent upon the
effective range scale, achievable positional accuracy, and any positioning
errors inherent to a towed system. A good rule of thumb to obtain complete
coverage is to plan survey line spacing at 1.6 x Range Scale, allowing for an
overlap of 40% of range scale (20% of the total swath) between adjacent swaths.
Note: Range Scale refers to the athwartships distance ensonified on each side of
the towfish. Thus, Range Scale equals one half of the total swath ensonified.</p>
<p>Generally, SSS range scale is chosen for maximum survey efficiency. The sonar
should be maintained at an altitude of 8 - 20% of range scale during
acquisition; thus, water depth will determine an upper range scale limit or a
particular survey area. However, the hydrographer should also consider the
system configuration and if a minimum sonar depth will be necessary to avoid
water column disturbances such as propeller wash. Based on the chosen range
scale’s corresponding ping rate, vessel speed should be adjusted to ensure that
object detection criteria are met (see section 2.5.2.1 ). If a specific range
scale is required for a survey, it will be indicated in the Project
Instructions.</p>
<h5 id="2-5-3-1-3-vertical-beam-echosounder-vbes-">2.5.3.1.3 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES)</h5>
<p>Since complete coverage can not be efficiently completed using VBES alone, this
will rarely be assigned as the sole method for acquiring mainscheme survey data.
Typically, VBES systems will be used to provide correlating sounding data for
SSS operations, define an inshore contour, or develop very shoal or foul areas
where there is a high probability of damaging either a MBES or SSS system.</p>
<p>If VBES has been assigned as a stand-alone mainscheme data acquisition method,
the required line spacing will be noted in the Project Instructions. If
possible, VBES mainscheme data should be acquired by running lines perpendicular
to depth contours. This practice assists the hydrographer in accurately
identifying contour intervals. If extensive discrepancies are found between VBES
sounding data and charted depths, the Chief of OPS or Chief of NRB should be
contacted to determine if a more extensive survey is warranted.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-3-2-holidays">2.5.3.2 Holidays</h4>
<p>Holidays are defined as gaps in mainscheme data or areas where accuracy
requirements have not been met. Holidays may be caused by various events, such
as vessel maneuvering, survey equipment problems, unexpected shoals, or
rejection of poor quality data during post-processing. Holiday line plans are
typically developed to address these data gaps as mainscheme acquisition
progresses, rather than at the end of mainscheme operations. This practice will
minimize transit time required to revisit each area of the survey with a holiday
and the time required to acquire, process, and manage additional sound speed
profiles. If the field unit uses a real-time coverage map during mainscheme data
acquisition, most holidays can be identified and addressed prior to ceasing
operations that day, thus increasing survey efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-3-3-crosslines">2.5.3.3 Crosslines</h4>
<p>Crossline data are used to identify any systematic data problems by comparing it
to mainscheme data acquired at different times, water levels, and line azimuths.
Separate vessels may also be used for crossline data acquisition to help
identify any vessel to vessel system biases.</p>
<p>Ideally, crosslines should be acquired prior to mainscheme data, in areas of
gently sloping bottom, and when water levels are as close to survey datum (MLLW)
as practicable. Crossline data may not agree well with mainscheme soundings if
acquired in areas of irregular submarine relief and/or if VBES systems are used.
In rocky areas, large depth differences may occur over small horizontal
distances, making a small positioning error appear to be a large depth error.
This effect is often noted when using VBES systems due to the large beam
footprint.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-3-4-developments">2.5.3.4 Developments</h4>
<p>A development is performed to either obtain a least depth over a known point
feature or further define an area based feature such as a shoal. Typically,
dense MBES data are acquired for developments, although multiple VBES lines may
be more appropriate for defining very shoal area features due to the significant
decrease of MBES efficiency in such depths. If a VBES system is used to
determine the least depth on a point feature, several parallel lines should be
run over the feature until the hydrographer is confident that the least depth is
recorded. A third method for determining a feature’s least depth is by diver
investigation. The process of using a diver least depth gauge is discussed in
section 3.2.5 For additional information on feature investigation, refer to
section 4.4. Note: Conducting developments during high stages of tide will
improve MBES efficiency and may also provide increased vessel safety by
maximizing underkeel clearance. If development lines are created to be run
during a specific tide range, the hydrographer must be certain to convey this
information to the vessel crew that will be acquiring the data.</p>
<p>When developing point features, least depths should be acquired using the center
region of the MBES swath, typically 45° or less off nadir. This section of the
MBES swath will have less error due to refraction than the outer beams. It is
recommended that, during development acquisition, a confidence swath be run in
an orthogonal direction to the primary development lines. A common MBES
development line plan may appear to be an assortment of “H” or “+” patterns over
numerous features.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-4-survey-polygon-planning">2.5.4 Survey Polygon Planning</h3>
<p>Most field units will be equipped with data acquisition software that allows the
sonar operator and the coxswain to view a real-time coverage DTM of the data
being acquired. As an alternative to line planning, which is most often
redundant with this software capability, polygons that define areas to be
covered are created by the sheet manager. While the entire area could just be
covered with a continuous line, polygons provide the hydrographer with discreet
sections to be covered assisting in better plans for survey timing and vessel
efficiency. Most of the guidance that applies to line plans also applies to
polygon planning. The data should still be acquired with the boat traveling
parallel to the contours.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Polygons should be planned such that the boat will be running offshore to
nearshore. This is a safety tip! Creating separate offshore and onshore polygons
(those that can be run at any time vs. those that need a specific tide window)
is also helpful.</p>
</li><li><p>Make polygons longer in the dimension the boat should run, providing a clear
indication to the coxswain and surveyor of the polygon’s directionality. (If
running N to S will be most efficient with the contours, make your polygon
longer in the N to S dimension).</p>
</li><li><p>If there is a MHW Buffer, a limit line that defines the shoal edge of the
survey (survey to the 4 meter curve) or a NALL established during shoreline
verification, do not plan polygons inshore of these limits unless there is a
specific reason to do so.</p>
</li><li><p>In a channel that could be filled in with one polygon (shore to shore),
consider breaking it down into two polygons such that there is a straight edge
in the middle of the channel. This provides the vessel with a straight baseline,
and encourages running from offshore to nearshore.</p>
</li><li><p>Set polygons up in such a way that turns are minimized and lines are of a
manageable length for processing.</p>
</li><li><p>Be aware of any possible sources of fresh water, or other factors that will
affect the water column and make smaller polygons in these areas.</p>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="2-5-4-1-awois-items">2.5.4.1 AWOIS Items</h4>
<p>For all assigned AWOIS investigations, the entire search radius shall be
investigated if possible, regardless of its position relative to the survey
limits. Specific investigation methods considered adequate for an item’s
disproval will be noted in the attributes of the placeholder AWOIS feature,
CRANES. Often, AWOIS items can be investigated in conjunction with mainscheme
data acquisition.</p>
<p>Note: If the entire search radius is not investigated, it is nearly impossible
to disprove an AWOIS item.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-4-2-target-files">2.5.4.2 Target Files</h4>
<p>Target files refer to a collection of geographic positions designated for point
data acquisition. These files are typically created to designate specific
positions for acquiring other types of data. For example, the hydrographer may
create a target file to show the specific position where a sound velocity
profile is desired or specific locations of items to be developed.</p>
<h5 id="2-5-4-2-1-bottom-samples">2.5.4.2.1 Bottom Samples</h5>
<p>Samples of bottom sediment throughout the survey area shall be obtained and
analyzed in accordance with the HSSD, if required by the Project Instructions. A
bottom sample plan is compiled by the HSD Project Manager and delivered to the
field unit in the Project Reference File (PRF) using the S- 57 Object Class,
‘SPRING’. The field unit should review the bottom sample plan to the survey data
acquired (bathymetry and backscatter) to determine if the bottom sample
locations are appropriate. The survey data will often better differentiate
varying bottom characteristics within the survey compared to the bottom sample
plan. The field unit should contact HSD Operations Branch to discuss modifying
the plan if needed.</p>
<h4 id="2-5-4-3-special-circumstances">2.5.4.3 Special Circumstances</h4>
<h5 id="2-5-4-3-1-search-patterns">2.5.4.3.1 Search Patterns</h5>
<p>In emergency or accident situations, NOAA field units may be involved with
wreck, obstruction, or debris searches. When planning this type of operation,
the direction of the search pattern should be oriented within 20° of the set of
any significant current present in the survey area. This arrangement will
minimize towfish offset from the planned tracks, increase position accuracy, and
increase towfish stability by minimizing forces that are not aligned with the
longitudinal axis of the towfish. However, tracks run in the same direction as a
very strong current may result in an increased speed over ground, which could
decrease object detection capabilities; thus, this parameter should be monitored
if searching for small objects. If strong currents exist in the area and running
search tracks in a pattern oriented normal to the current is unavoidable, the
operations should be timed to coincide with periods of slack or minimum current,
if possible.</p>
<h5 id="2-5-4-3-2-special-wreck-investigations">2.5.4.3.2 Special Wreck Investigations</h5>
<p>If a hydrographic field unit discovers a potentially significant historic wreck
site, or conducts a special wreck investigation through a contract from another
NOAA program or a request from a NOAA Navigation Manager, the field unit should
make an effort to ensonify the wreck site and associated debris field with each
type of sonar system that is readily available. When conducting side scan sonar
operations, run parallel tracks on either side of the wreck, so that both sides
are imaged, as well as two additional tracks orthogonal to the site. The imagery
and bathymetry data will provide clues to the wreck’s status and identity,
identify any obstructions, and provide researchers with an adequate baseline
assessment with which to compare future surveys.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-5-survey-plan-finalization">2.5.5 Survey Plan Finalization</h3>
<p>Proposed survey acquisition plans should be reviewed by the FOO and/or Chief-of-
Party and any necessary adjustments made. Once approved by the Chief-of-Party,
the plan should be converted from the format generated by the GIS software used
to design the plan to a format that can be read by the field unit’s survey
navigation software. Typically, acquisition plans will be designed using CARIS
Notebook or Bathy DataBASE software for polygon planning or MapInfo software for
line planning. The MapInfo files are converted into a HYPACK line file (<em>.lnw)
or HYPACK target file (</em>.tgt) for vessel navigation. This specific conversion
process can be accomplished using the Hydro_MI.mbx MapBasic tool, which will
also report the number and the total mileage of the planned lines. Number and
mileage statistics should be recorded and used to estimate the amount of time
required to complete the survey. These estimations are critical to overall
project planning.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-6-preparing-the-survey-crew">2.5.6 Preparing the Survey Crew</h3>
<p>The Survey Manager will provide a boat sheet to the survey crew(s) with a plot
depicting line plans, polygons, and/or shoreline files overlaid on the largest
scale chart with any uncharted hazards, lines planned for acquisition during
high tide or slack current, AWOIS items, contacts, and/or developments prior to
each survey day.</p>
