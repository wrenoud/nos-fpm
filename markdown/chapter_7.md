Glossary

7.1 A
------

ABANDONED
An adjective referring to a man-made facility no longer being used for its original purpose. The term may be used
with a symbol, e.g., beside an airport symbol, or with a place name, e.g., Elma (Abandoned).

ABSOLUTE ERROR
Absolute deviation (the value taken without regard to its sign) from the corresponding true value.
ACCRETION
The gradual building up of land over a long period of time, solely by the action of the forces of nature, on a beach
by deposition of water or airborne material. Artificial accretion is a similar build-up of land by reason of an act of
man. Also called aggradations.

ACCURACY
Closeness of a measured or estimated value to a standard or accepted value of a particular quantity.
ACROSS TRACK
The dimension of the seabed or data record in a direction lateral to the track of the survey vessel or towfish.
This is the opposite of the along-track dimension. These two terms are used to describe sonar phenomena and
dimensional corrections.

ADJUSTED POSITION
An adjusted geographic position of a point on the earth in which discrepancies arising from errors in the
observational data are removed; a fixed position.

ADR GAUGE
Analog to Digital Recording tide gauge. A float or pressure actuated tide gauge that records the heights at regular
time intervals in digital format.

ADRIFT
Afloat or unattached to shore or bottom.

AERIAL SURVEY
A survey using aerial photographs as part of the surveying operation; also, the taking of aerial photographs for
surveying purposes.

AEROTRIANGULATION
Triangulation for the extension of horizontal and (or) vertical control accomplished by means of aerial photographs.
AFLOAT
Floating, as opposed to being aground.

*Page 197*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGROUND
Touching, resting, or lodged on the seafloor in shallow water. The opposite is afloat.

AID TO NAVIGATION
A device external to a craft, designed to assist in determination of position of the craft, a safe course, or to warn
of dangers or obstructions. The expression “Aid to Navigation” should not be confused with “Navigational Aid”,
a broad expression covering any instrument, device, chart, method, etc., intended to assist in the navigation of a
craft. See Navigational Aid.

ALMANAC
The almanac is a set of parameters used by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to predict the approximate
location of a navigation satellite and the expected offset of the satellite’s clock. Each GPS satellite contains and
transmits the almanac data for the entire satellite network. See Ephemeris.

ALONG TRACK
The dimension of the seabed or data record in a direction parallel to the track of the towfish (transverse). This is the
opposite of the across track dimension. These two terms are used to describe sonar phenomena and dimensional
corrections.

ALTITUDE
The height of a towfish above the seabed, typically measured in feet or meters. Proper towfish altitude is important
for acceptable seabed backscattering and to avoid seabed collisions. An excessively low altitude will reduce the
range at which effective backscattering is produced. Excessively high altitudes can leave unensonified seabed as
well as prevent accurate slant range correction.

AMBIENT NOISE
Acoustic signals, sensed by the sonar system, emanating from a variety of sources in the underwater environment.
Ambient noise visible in sonar data can result from propeller cavitation, engine noise, and biological sources.
Other sources are environmental, such as wind, waves, and rain.

ANCHORAGE
An area where a ship anchors or may anchor, either because of suitability or designation. A suitable place for
anchoring is sheltered from wind and sea, does not interfere with harbor traffic, and has a sea bottom that gives
good holding to anchors. The anchorage space allotted to a vessel should include a circle with a radius equal to
the combined length of anchor chain and ship.

ANCHORAGE CHART
A nautical chart showing prescribed or recommended anchorages. Such a chart may be a harbor chart overprinted
with a series of circles, each indicating an individual anchorage.

ANGLE OF INCIDENCE
The angle that a straight line acoustic pulse meeting a surface makes with a normal to the surface. The angle of
incidence is important in sonar backscattering. For instance, if the sonar altitude is too low, at long ranges the
angle of incidence with the seabed becomes high. Much of the incident energy is not returned to the transducer.
Further, if the seabed angles up at the outer ranges, the angle of incidence becomes lower and more energy will
be returned, making a notable anomaly in the data.

APPARENT SHORELINE
The seaward limits of marine vegetation, such as mangrove, marsh grass, or trees in water that would reasonably
appear to the mariner from a distance to be the fast shoreline. The seaward limits of kelp, low grass in water, and

*Page 198*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

other low-lying vegetation normally do not constitute an apparent shoreline. A line drawn on the chart in lieu of
the mean high water line or the mean water level line in areas where either may be obscured by marsh, mangrove,
cypress, or other type of marine vegetation. This line represents the intersection of the appropriate vertical datum
with the outer limits of vegetation and appears to the navigator as shoreline.

APPROXIMATE CONTOUR
A contour substituted for a normal contour whenever there is a question as to its reliability (reliability is defined
as being accurate within one-half the contour interval).

APPROXIMATE POSITION
A charting term meaning a position that is considered to be within 100 ft of its correct geographic location but less
than third order or equivalent specification. Usually shown by the abbreviation “P.A.” Alternative form: Position
Approximate.

ARCHIVE MEDIA
Either magnetic media or compact discs. Magnetic media includes DAT DDS 4 mm tapes, DLT (digital linear
tape), 8 mm Exabyte tape, and Ultrium LTO (linear optical tape). Compact discs include both CDs and DVDs.
ARTIFACT
Bias-related error. See Bias, Systematic Error.

AREA AND DEPTH SHEETS
A plotted representation of information acquired during a wire-drag survey. The results of the survey are depicted
as polygons representing the areas of coverage by the wire drag apparatus. Only the deepest of these is shown.
Each area is annotated with the corrected depth of the wire at the time of operations. The sheets may also include
information identifying specific depths at locations of hangs or groundings.

AREA CHARTS
NOS charts which are versions of conventional nautical charts overprinted with additional small-craft information,
and published in the pocket-fold format.

AREA FEATURE
An area feature is an item such as a fish haven, a disposal area, or a prohibited or quarantine area which consists
of a region with defined boundaries.

ARGO
A medium-range electronic positioning system once used for horizontal control purposes during hydrographic
surveys.

ATOLL
A coral island or islands, consisting of a belt of coral reef surrounding a central lagoon. A ring-shaped coral reef
which has closely spaced islands or islets on it enclosing a deeper central area or lagoon. The diameter may vary
from less than a mile to 80 miles or more.

ATTENUATION
The process of weakening or reducing the amplitude of a sonar signal. It is caused by numerous factors, including
material dispersion, beam spreading, and absorption. The attenuation of a sonar signal makes its detection more
difficult. Reflected signals from far ranges are sometimes attenuated to such a degree that system noise in the
sonar receiver electronics can be a problem.

*Page 199*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTOMATED WRECK AND OBSTRUCTION INFORMATION SYSTEM (AWOIS)
A database containing information about wrecks and obstructions located in areas charted by NOAA. The primary
purpose of this system is to support operational hydrography, although it is available online to the general public.
AUV
Acronym for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, an unmanned underwater vehicle that conducts operations from
pre-programmed instructions without being tethered or otherwise attached to a support vessel. See ROV.
AWASH
Situated so that the top is intermittently washed by waves or tidal action. The term applies both to fixed objects
such as rocks, and to floating objects with their tops flush with or slightly above the surface of the water.
AWOIS
See Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System.

AZIMUTH
A horizontal angle reckoned clockwise from the meridian. In the basic control surveys of the U. S., azimuths
have been historically reckoned from south. In 1986, when the NGS began publishing geodetic data on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), the measurement of azimuths was referenced from the north for basic control
surveys.

7.2 B

BACKSCATTER
The deflection of acoustic energy in a scattering process, commonly used to describe the return of energy from the
seabed to the receiver of a sonar. See Scattering.

BACKSHORE
That part of a beach which is usually dry, being reached only by the highest tides and, by extension, a narrow strip
of relatively flat coast bordering the sea.

BANK
1. An elevation of the sea floor located on a continental or an island shelf and over which the depth of water is
relatively shallow but sufficient for safe surface navigation. Reefs or shoals, dangerous to surface navigation, may
rise above the general depths of a bank. 2. A shallow area consisting of shifting forms of silt, sand, mud, and gravel;
in this case it is only used with a qualifying word, such as “sandbank” or “gravelbank.” 3. The edge of a cut or fill.
The edge of a waterway or channel.

BAR
A ridge or mound of sand, gravel, or other unconsolidated material below the high water level, especially at the
mouth of a river or estuary, or lying a short distance from and usually parallel to the beach, and which may
obstruct navigation.

BAR CHECK
A method of field-calibrating sounding equipment used in a hydrographic survey by suspending a bar or disc
beneath the echosounder transducer at various depths. Echoes from this surface are compared to the actual known
depth of the bar.

*Page 200*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BARE

than one foot above mean high water on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, and extending more than two feet above
mean high water on the Pacific coast.

BARRIER REEF
A coral reef fronting, but at some distance from, the shore and separated from the shore by a lagoon.
BAR SCALE
A line or series of lines on a chart or map subdivided and labeled with the distances represented on the chart or
map. Also called Graphic Scale.

BASE LINE
A surveyed line established with more than usual care to which surveys are referred for coordination and correlation.
Base lines are established for specific purposes; the pertinent ones are defined below: 1. The side of one of a series
of connected triangles, the length of which is measured to a prescribed standard of accuracy and from which the
lengths of the sides of the other triangles were obtained by computation. Base lines in triangulation are classified
according to the character of the work they were intended to control; the instruments and methods used in their
measurement assure that the prescribed standards of accuracy were met. 2. The reference used to position limits
of the territorial sea and the contiguous zone. The U. S. base line is determined from the mean lower low water
line. The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea defined the low water line along a coast, as shown on
large-scale charts of the coastal State (country), to be the base line for determining the limit of the territorial sea.
BASE (BATHYMETRY ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICAL ERROR) SURFACE
A CARIS software generated seafloor model, created by one or more different algorithms, that contains depth and
uncertainty at each model node. It can also contain one or more auxiliary information layers, including standard
deviation of soundings, sounding density, shoal depth, source identification, hypothesis count, hypothesis strength,
and others, in addition to the basic bathymetric layer. Content of the auxiliary layers depends on the algorithm
used to construct the BASE surface.

BASIC SURVEY (Hydrographic)
A comprehensive and complete hydrographic survey adequate to supersede all prior hydrographic surveys covering
the common area, and to verify or discredit/disprove the existence of all charted or reported features.
BATHYMETRIC MAP

between and inside of two headlands. According to the Geneva Convention, a well-marked indentation whose
penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain landlocked waters and constitute more
than a mere curvature of the coast. The area of such an indentation must be as large as, or larger than, the semicircle
whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of the indentation. (The specifications are contained in Article 7

*Page 201*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.)

3. To intentionally run a craft ashore, as a landing ship.

BEACON 1. A fixed aid to navigation. 2. Anything serving as a signal or conspicuous indication, either for guidance
or warning.

BEAM COMPASS A drafting instrument for drawing circles with a long radius. The point and the pen, or pencil
tip, are separate units, mounted to slide and clamp on a long bar or “beam” so that the distance between them is
equal to the desired radius.

BEAM FORMING
The process of shaping an acoustic beam through the control of the geometry of the transducer array. As the shape
of the acoustic beam is crucial in imaging sonar systems, careful beam forming is important. The size, shape, and
arrangement of groups of transducer elements help form the beam.

BEAM SPREADING
The divergence of a sonar beam as a direct function of angle and range. Beam spreading causes a loss of resolution
in the far ranges; however, where the beam is wider the system ensonifies more of the environment per ping. Beam
spreading also causes adjacent beams in the far ranges to overlap, which may be advantageous in some side scan
sonar operations.

BEAM WIDTH
The angular measure of the transverse section of a beam (usually in the main lobe) lying within directions
corresponding to specified values of field strength (usually -3 db) relative to the maximum.

BEARING
The horizontal direction of a line of sight between two objects on the surface of the earth.

BED
The ground upon which a body of water rests. The term is usually used with a modifier to indicate the type of water
body, as river bed or sea bed.

BELL BUOY
A steel float surmounted by a short skeleton tower in which the bell is fixed. Most bell buoys are sounded by
the motion of the buoy in the sea. In a few buoys, the bells are struck by compressed gas or electrically operated
hammers.

BENCH MARK
A fixed physical object containing a marked point of known elevation with respect to a datum used as a reference
level for tidal observations or as a control point for leveling. With the advent of GPS an increasing number of
bench marks are also used for spatial reference with regard to horizontal control.

*Page 202*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BENCH MARK (Tidal)
A fixed physical object or mark used as reference for a horizontal or vertical datum. A tidal bench mark is one near
a tide station to which the tide staff and tidal datums are referred. A primary bench mark is the principal mark of
a group of tidal bench marks to which the tide staff and tidal datums are referred. The standard tidal bench mark
of the National Ocean Service is a brass, bronze, or aluminum alloy disk 3-1/2 inches in diameter containing the
inscription NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE, together with other individual identifying information. A geodetic
bench mark identifies a surveyed point in the National Spatial Reference System. Bench mark disks of either type
may, on occasion, serve simultaneously to reference both tidal and geodetic datums.

BERTH

BIAS
The distortion of a result through negligence of a factor usually introducing a systematic error of unchanging
magnitude and sign throughout a given series of observations.

BIFURCATION BUOY

channel divides in two. See also Junction Buoy.

BIGHT
A bend or curve; a bend in a coast forming an open bay; a small open bay formed by an indentation in the coast;
a minor feature which affords little protection for vessels.

BIN (BIN, BINNED, BINNING)
One process used to thin dense hydrographic data where the shoalest sounding is selected in an N-by-N m box,
called a bin. Another method of data decimation is called “gridding” which considers points in proximity to a grid
node – usually a radial distance.

BLUE TINT CURVE
A nautical charting term describing the use of a blue tint in the water areas associated with a depth curve or
contour. The blue tint curve is considered the danger curve for vessels expected to use that particular chart.
BLUNDER
A mistake. A blunder is not an error, although a small blunder may remain undetected in a series of observations
and have the effect of an error in determining the result. Examples of blunders are: reading a horizontal circle
incorrectly by an even degree; neglecting to record the tape length in a measured traverse; and reversing numerals
in recording an observation.

BOAT HOUSE
A building at or near a shore for the storage of boats.

BOAT SHEET
The work sheet used by a hydrographer in the field for plotting the details of a hydrographic survey as it progresses.
It may include projection lines, control stations, shoreline, and proposed sounding lines, and corresponds to what
was termed a “diagram,” “sounding sheet,” or a “working sheet” in early project instructions.

*Page 203*

BOOM
A floating barrier used to protect a river or harbor mouth or to create a harbored area for storage purposes. See
also log boom.

BORE
A very rapid rise of the tide in which the advancing water presents an abrupt front of considerable height. Bores
generally occur in shallow estuaries where the range of tide is large.

BOTTOM CHARACTERISTICS
Designations used on smooth sheets and nautical/navigational charts to indicate the size, consistency, color,
and classification of bottom sediments. Thus, “soft gray sand, shells, pebbles” is designated “sft gy S Sh P.” The
expressions “bottom characteristics” and “bottom sample” are not to be used interchangeably.

BOTTOM SAMPLE
Samples of the ocean bottom obtained by means of a mechanical device designed to collect relatively small-sized
material. The actual bottom materials/sediments obtained in the “sampling” procedure.

BOULDER

BOUNDING MERIDIAN
A meridian which is coincident with a part of the neat line of a map or chart.

BOWDITCH
See Publication No. 9.

BREAKER
A wave that has become so steep that the crest of the wave topples forward, moving faster than the main
body of the wave.

BREAKWATER
A structure protecting a shore area, harbor, anchorage, or basin from waves. A floating breakwater is a contrivance
consisting of floating materials connected by mooring chains or cables attached to anchors or stone blocks in such
a manner as to form a basin within which vessels may be protected from the violence of waves. A breakwater may
be attached to or separated from the shore. Part of the coast line from which maritime zones are measured.
BRIDGE
A structure designed to carry traffic over a depression or other obstruction. The term refers to a lawful bridge over
navigable waters of the United States, including approaches, fenders, and appurtenances thereto, which is used and
operated for the purpose of carrying railroad traffic, or both railroad and highway traffic, or if a State, county or
municipality, or other political subdivision is the owner or joint owner thereof, which is used and operated for the
purpose of carrying highway traffic.

BRIDGE CLEARANCE

produce digital images of paper charts. File extensions are *.bsb and *.kap.

BULKHEAD
1. A structure built to retain or prevent sliding of the land. A secondary purpose is to protect the upland against
damage from wave action. Bulkheads are frequently filled behind, thereby increasing the utility of the adjacent
land.

2. A nautical term used aboard ship. It is analogous to a “wall” in a building.

BUOY
A floating object, other than a lightship, moored or anchored to the bottom to serve as an aid to navigation. Buoys
may be classified according to shape, color, or special purpose.

BUOYAGE
A system of buoys. One in which the buoys are assigned shape, color, and number distinction in accordance with
location relative to the nearest obstruction is called a cardinal system. One in which buoys are assigned shape,
color, and number distinction as a means of indicating navigable waters is called a lateral system.

7.3 C

CABLE
A unit of distance originally equal to the length of a ship’s anchor cable, but now generally considered to be about
600 feet. In the British Navy it is 608 feet, or exactly one-tenth of a nautical mile. In the U.S. Navy it is 720 feet but
is infrequently used.

CADASTRAL SURVEY
A cadastral survey is a land survey that defines boundaries, property lines, and other measurements pertaining to
an official register of ownership, known as a cadastre. A cadastral survey helps determine the expanse and value of
real property for resale and taxation.

CAIRN

intended to portray the general shape and size of these lakes and to provide information of interest to campers and
boaters.

CANYON
On the sea floor, a relatively narrow, deep depression with steep sides, the bottom of which generally has a
continuous slope.

CAPE
A relatively extensive land area jutting seaward from a continent or large island, which prominently marks a
change in or interrupts notably the coastal trend.

CARDINAL POINT
Any of the four principal directions: north, east, south, or west. Directions midway between cardinal points are
called inter-cardinal points.

CARDINAL SYSTEM
A buoyage system generally used to indicate dangers where the coast is flanked by numerous islands, rocks, and
shoals, as well as to indicate dangers in the open sea. In this system the bearing (true) of the mark from the danger is
indicated to the nearest cardinal point. The buoys are assigned shape, color, and number distinction in accordance
with location relative to the nearest obstruction. The cardinal points delineate the sectors for buoy location.
CARIS FIELD SHEET
See field sheet.

CARRIER PHASE
The fraction of a cycle often expressed in degrees, where 360 degrees equals a complete cycle. Carrier phase can
also mean the number of complete cycles plus a fractional cycle. A survey-grade GPS receiver can lock-on to a
satellite and count the number of whole cycles of the carrier frequency, measuring the cumulative phase of the
signal. This is often referred to as integrated Doppler.

CARTESIAN COORDINATES
Named after René Descartes, a French philosopher and mathematician. A pair of numbers (x, y), defining the
position of a point in a two-dimensional space by its perpendicular projection onto two axes which are at right
angle to each other.

CARTOGRAPHER
One who practices Cartography, particularly a member of a profession regularly concerned with any stage in the
evaluation, compilation, design, or drafting of a map or chart.

CARTOGRAPHIC CODE
A proprietary system of numeric identifiers used to index a variety of cartographic symbols used in the compilation
of smooth sheets. The codes may also appear embedded in various digital records containing information on
sounding and features observed during a hydrographic survey.

CARTOGRAPHIC FEATURE

feature, line feature, and area feature.

*Page 206*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CARTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION
The process of interpreting data for a particular purpose, such as nautical charting. Selected features are retained
and highlighted in the data, and other features may be neglected or shifted, depending on the purpose of the
product.

CARTOGRAPHY
The art, science, and technology of making maps, together with their study as scientific documents and works
of art. In this context maps may be regarded as including all types of maps, plans, charts, and sections, threedimensional models, and globes representing the Earth or any celestial body at any scale.
CASCADE
A fall of water over steeply sloping rocks, usually comparatively small or one of a series.

CATENARY
The curve(s) assumed by a tow cable moving through the water, typically induced by the forces of water drag on
the cable. The catenary is a significant factor in computing the horizontal distance to a towfish from the towing
block. Towfish drag coefficients, cable weight, and drag and length-of-cable-out determine the shape of cable
catenaries. The sweep wire as part of a wire-drag rig also assumes the catenary shape when being towed.
CATARACT
A waterfall, usually larger than a cascade, over a precipice.

CAUSEWAY
A raised way, as for a road across wet ground or water.

CAY
A low, flat island of sand, coral, etc., awash or drying at low water; a term originally applied to the coral islets
around the coast and islands of the Caribbean Sea. When spelled key, refers to a low, insular bank of sand, coral,
etc., (e.g., one of the islets off the southern coast of Florida).

C-COAST
(Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table) The NGS’s attribution scheme which was developed
to conform the attribution of various sources of shoreline data into one attribution catalog. C-COAST is not
a recognized standard but was influenced by the IHO’s S-57 Object-Attribute standard so that the data would
be more accurately translated into S-57. C-COAST is used to attribute GC’s which are provided to field units
conducting hydrography.

CENTERLINE CONTROLLING DEPTH
The controlling depth of a waterway which applies only to the center of the waterway; it is usually the result of a
reconnaissance-type survey consisting of only a few lines of soundings which do not provide adequate coverage to
determine the controlling depth of the entire waterway.

CENTRAL MERIDIAN
1. The line of longitude at the center of a projection. Generally, the basis for constructing the projection. 2. The
longitude of origin at the center of each 6-degree zone of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. The central
meridian is arbitrarily numbered 500,000 and called a false easting. 3. In the State Plane Coordinate System, the
meridian is used as the y-axis for computing projection tables for a state coordinate system. The central meridian
of the system usually passes close to the center of the figure of the area or zone for which the tables are computed.

*Page 207*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAIN
1. A group of associated stations of a radio navigation system. A LORAN-C chain consists of a master station and
2 - 4 secondary stations. 2. The unit of length prescribed by law for the survey of the public lands of the United
States. The chain is equivalent to 66 ft or 4 rods, poles, or perches. Ten square chains equal one acre.
CHANNEL
1. A natural or artificial waterway of perceptible extent which either periodically or continuously contains moving
water, or which forms a connecting link between two bodies of water. 2. The part of a body of water deep enough
to be used for navigation through an area otherwise too shallow for navigation. 3. The deepest portion of a stream,
bay, or strait through which the main volume or current of water flows. 4. A band of radio frequencies with
which a radio station must maintain its modulated carrier frequency to prevent interference with stations on
adjacent channels. 5. One of two or more signals in a multi-signal sonar system; the area on the display or sonar
record where data from this signal is shown. Modern instrumented sonar systems may utilize separate channels
for many kinds of data such as: port and starboard side scan, sub bottom, towbody heading, depth, conductivity,
temperature, and magnetometry.

CHAPP
Chart History And Plotting Parameter file containing identifying information concerning each KAPP in the
database.

CHART (Nautical)
A special purpose map specifically designed to meet the requirements of, and to promote, safe navigation. Included
on most nautical/navigational charts are: depths of water, characteristics of the bottom, elevations of selected
topographic features, general configuration of the coast or shoreline, dangers, obstructions and aids to navigation,
limited water level data, and information about magnetic variation in the charted area.

CHART (Navigational)
Similar to a Nautical Chart but different in that it consists of a database of chart features and their attributes which
is used in an ECDIS to construct and query a chart-like display. The ENC data is written in an exchange standard
of the IHO designated S-57. See ECDIS and ENC .

CHART AGENT
Business establishments that are under contract with NOAA and receive discounts for resale of nautical and
aeronautical navigational charts and related publications to the general public at retail prices stipulated by the
agency.

CHART DATUM
The datum to which soundings on a chart are referred. It is usually taken to correspond to a low-water elevation.
Since 1989, chart datum has been Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) for all marine waters of the United States, its
territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Depths on charts of
inland waters may be referenced to a local datum. CHARTED DEPTH The vertical distance from the chart datum
to the seafloor, lake or river bottom.

CHART EVALUATION FILE (CEF)
An ESRI Shapefile containing 2-D polygons intended for overlay on an included NOAA nautical chart (or set
of charts) within a Geographic Information System. The CEF is created in association with a photogrammetric
shoreline mapping or change analysis project, in order to document navigational hazards, landmarks, fixed aids,
and coastline features portrayed on NOAA nautical chart products whose existence or geographic position can
not be confirmed photogrammetrically, or whose size, shape, orientation or position appear to have changed
significantly from the current chart portrayal.

*Page 208*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHART EVALUATION SURVEY (CES)
A product of NOAA’s Chart Evaluations Surveys (CES) program intended to: * Resolve all deficiencies reported
or discovered. A deficiency is defined as charted information that can be made more complete through field
examination, or information which should be charted but is not. * Evaluate the adequacy/accuracy of hydrographic
information on existing charts. * Verify or revise information published in the appropriate Coast Pilot. Conduct
user evaluation and public relations efforts to provide an awareness of agency products and obtain user input.
CHART HISTORY

history preserves, in compact form, every detail and authority used on the chart, together with the date when a
correction was applied. Also called History Sheet.

CHART LETTER
A designation applied to source documents received by the agency for use in revising nautical/navigational charts.
They may originate from within or outside the agency. The physical size of the document determines whether it is
registered as a chart letter or a blueprint. Each document is registered within the source data system with a unique
identifier number.

CHART MAINTENANCE PRINT
An annotated copy of a shoreline map, a revision print, a revised topographic map, a photogrammetrically revised
chart, or other graphic generated photogrammetrically, showing the differences between that document and the
latest edition of the largest-scale nautical chart of the area.

CHART PROJECTION
See Map Projection, Projection .

CHARTLET
1. A small chart or portion of a chart scaled and used to display survey data. 2. A corrected reproduction of a
small area of a nautical chart which is pasted to the chart for which it is issued. These chartlets are disseminated in

The 32 divisions of a compass, at intervals of 11 ¼°. Each division is further divided into quarter points.
COMPASS ROSE
A circle graduated in degrees, clockwise from 0° at the reference direction to 360°, and sometimes also in compass
points. Compass roses are placed at convenient locations on the nautical chart or plotting sheet to facilitate
measurement of direction.

regard to the field’s charting recommendation concerning specific features.

CONCUR WITH CLARIFICATION
Cartographic agreement, requiring better description without confusion as to the data verification and charting
recommendation. In general, this means the cartographic verifier agrees or concurs with the field hydrographer,
providing additional comments are added. The note will usually indicate where the additional cartographic
comments should be placed, along with additional descriptions that are needed for clarification.

CONE OF SILENCE
In three dimensions, the Cone of Silence is the area that begins at the intersection of two overlapping swaths of
multibeam coverage and continues upward to the water’s surface. Any object or part of an object that falls within

CONTERMINOUS UNITED STATES
Comprises the 48 States of the United States and the District of Columbia; all of the states exclusive of Alaska and
Hawaii. They have common boundaries and are not separated by foreign territory or the high seas.

CONTIGUOUS ZONE
1. A zone seaward of the territorial sea in which coastal states may assert jurisdiction short of complete sovereignty.
Article 24 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone authorizes such a zone “to prevent

*Page 211*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations in territory or territorial sea.. . . ” Under the
Convention, the contiguous area may extend no more than 12 miles from the coast line. 2. The belt of high seas, 9
nautical miles wide, that is adjacent to and seaward of the territorial seas of the United States and that was declared
to exist in Department of State Public Notice 358 of June 1, 1972, FR 11906.

CONTINENTAL MARGIN
The zone, generally consisting of shelf, slope, and rise, separating the continent from the abyssal plain or deep
sea bottom.

CONTINENTAL RISE
A gentle slope rising from the oceanic depths toward the foot of a continental slope.

CONTINENTAL SHELF
The submerged portion of a continent which slopes gently (average slope of less than 1:100) seaward from the
low-water line to a point where a substantial break in grade occurs, at which point the bottom slopes seaward at
a considerable increase in slope (typically exceeding 1:40) until the great ocean depths are reached. The point of
break defines the “edge” of the shelf, and the steeper sloping bottom the continental slope. Conventionally, the edge
is taken at 100 fm (or 200 m), but instances are known where the increase in slope occurs at more than 200 fm or
less than 65 fm. Alternate juridical (legal) definition: Under the UN Conference on Law of the Sea, Article 76, the
continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its
territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin,
or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured
where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.

Under certain circumstances a coastal State may submit a claim for an extension of its continental shelf beyond
200 nautical miles.

The relatively steep descent from the edge of the continental shelf to the deep-sea floor, usually a very irregular
area.

CONTROL
1. The coordinated and correlated dimensional data used in geodesy and cartography to determine the positions
and elevations of points on the land, sea, lake, river, air, etc., or on a cartographic representation of the surface.
2. A collective term for a system of marks or objects on the earth or on a map or photograph, whose positions or
elevations (or both) have been or will be determined.

CONTROLLING DEPTH
1. The least depth in the approach or channel to an area, such as a port or anchorage, governing the maximum draft
of vessels that can enter. See Federal Project Depth. 2. The least depth within the limits of a channel; it restricts the

*Page 212*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

safe use of the channel to drafts of less than that depth. The centerline controlling depth of a channel applies only
to the channel centerline; lesser depths may exist in the remainder of the channel. The mid-channel controlling
depth of a channel is the controlling depth only for the middle half of the channel.

CONTROL STATION
A point on the ground whose horizontal or vertical location is used as a basis for obtaining locations of other
points.

CONVENTIONAL CHARTS
Flat, printed reproductions published by NOAA of some portion of the navigational part of the Earth’s surface.
Depending on their scale, these charts show the nature and shape of the coast, depth of the water, general
configuration and character of the bottom, prominent landmarks, port facilities, cultural details, dredged channels,
aids to navigation, marine hazards, magnetic variations, and seaward boundaries. Changes brought about by
people and nature require that nautical charts be constantly maintained to aid safe navigation. NOAA’s area of
responsibility includes the national and territorial coastal waters of the United States, including the Great Lakes,
Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, U.S. Trust Territories, and other islands in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
CONVENTION ON THE TERRITORIAL SEA AND THE CONTIGUOUS ZONE
One of the four Conventions on the law of the sea adopted at Geneva in 1958 which, among other things, sets
out principles for establishing the baseline from which maritime zones of jurisdiction will be measured. 15 U.S.T
1606. Those principles were later adopted by the United States Supreme Court for purposes of implementing the
Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C 1301 et seq. Sometimes referred to herein simply as “the Convention.”
COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC)
A “time” referencing term which supersedes, but is generally equivalent to, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The new
UTC time scale is almost perfectly constant, since it is based on stable atomic clocks. GMT is based upon a form
of solar time-keeping and is approximately the same as UTC. See Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC is a time
scale that is based on the second (SI), as defined and recommended by the CCIR (International Radio Consultative
Committee, of the International Telecommunications Union), and maintained by the Bureau International des
Poids et Measures (BIPM). For most practical purposes associated with the Radio Regulations, UTC is equivalent
to mean solar time at the prime meridian (0° longitude), formerly expressed in GMT. The maintenance by BIPM
includes cooperation among various national laboratories around the world. Adjustments to the atomic, i.e., the
UTC, time scale consist of an occasional addition or deletion of 1 full second, which is called a leap second. Twice
yearly, during the last minute of the day of June 30 and of December 31, Universal Time, adjustments may be made.
Historically, adjustments, when necessary, have usually consisted of adding an extra second to the UTC time scale
in order to allow the rotation of the Earth to “catch up.” Therefore, the last minute of the UTC time scale, on the
day when an adjustment is made, will have 59 or 61 seconds. UTC is also called World Time, Z Time, Zulu Time.
COORDINATES
Linear or angular quantities which designate the position of a point in relation to a given reference system.
CORAL
Hard calcareous skeletons of many tribes of marine polyps. In the strict sense, a bottom-dwelling marine organism
which secretes an external skeleton of calcium carbonate and which frequently forms large, irregularly shaped
colonies with numerous coral heads and pinnacles. Coral formations usually consist of a mixture of coral and other
marine organisms, along with other debris and chemically precipitated rock. For shoreline mapping purposes, a
coral formation is a naturally occurring, consolidated mass of hard calcareous matter which is too large to be
adequately represented on the shoreline map by a single rock (coral) symbol. These formations include masses of
irregular shape, as well as those relatively flat, ledge type features that may fringe a shore.

*Page 213*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORAL HEAD

periodically extends above and is submerged below the surface. See also Awash.

CRIB
A permanent marine structure usually designed to support or elevate pipelines; especially a structure enclosing
a screening device at the offshore end of a potable water intake pipe. The structure is commonly a heavy timber
enclosure that has been sunken with rocks or other debris.

CRIT
Informal name for the critical corrections database that is used in the Update Service Branch. The CRIT database
was started in 1991 and includes all corrections from the LNM and NM and Canadian Notice. It is used by all
cartographers and is a major research tool as well as application history.

CRITICAL SURVEY AREA
Per the NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities document, critical survey areas are defined as waterways with high
commercial traffic volumes (cargo, fishing vessels, cruise ships, ferries, etc., extensive petroleum or hazardous
material transport, compelling requests from users, and/or transiting vessels with low under-keel clearance over
the seafloor. Approximately 43,000 square nautical miles of critical survey areas were identified in 1994 by NOAA
and given the highest priority for hydrographic survey. New areas are continuously being identified as critical
based on changing usage and are designated as emerging critical areas.

CROSSLINES
Sounding lines that cross the main system of survey lines at either right angles or at an oblique angle. Cross line
data is acquired, processed, and evaluated as a system check. Crosslines are not an accuracy test or assessment, but
a system check comparing data from different times and different line azimuths or directions.

CULTURAL FEATURE
A feature delineated on a survey, map, or chart which represent objects either constructed by, or resulting from the
actions of man, e.g., shipwrecks, roads, buildings, canals, piers, etc.

DANGER LINE
1. A line drawn on a chart to indicate the limits of safe navigation for a vessel of specific draft. 2. A line of small dots
used to draw the navigator’s attention to a danger which would not stand out clearly enough if it were represented
on the chart solely by the specific symbols. The line of small dots is also used to delimit areas containing numerous
dangers, through which it is unsafe to navigate.

DANGEROUS WRECK A wreck either visible or submerged at such a depth as to be considered a danger to
navigation with respect to local vessel traffic. See derelict and wreck.

DANGER TO NAVIGATION (DTON)
Any feature, e.g., a wreck, obstruction, depth, or condition deemed to constitute a potential risk to mariners.
Advisory information is published by the U. S. Coast Guard in the Local Notice to Mariners and by National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in the Notice to Mariners.

DAPR
See Data Acquisition and Processing Report. DATA General term used to denote facts, numbers, letters, and
symbols. The basic elements of information; usually but not always expressed in numerical form.

DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING REPORT
A project-wide survey report that is separated into three sections: Equipment, Quality Control, and Corrections to
Echo Soundings. Refer to NOS Specifications and Deliverables, June 2006 Edition.

DATA FLIERS
Erroneous data points that could be the result of noise interference within the water column, operational parameters
or settings such as TVG (time varied gain), pulse widths, pulse lengths, power and/or gain levels.
DATAGRAM
A discrete package of data and headers which contain addresses (which is the basic unit of transmission across an
IP network). Also called a ‘packet’.

DATUM
Any numerical or geometrical quantity or set of such quantities which may serve as a reference or base for other
quantities. In geodesy a datum is defined by a set of parameters specifying the reference surface or the reference
coordinate system. Therefore, two types of datums are required: a horizontal datum which forms the basis for
computations of horizontal control surveys and a vertical datum to which elevations or depths are referred.
DATUM CORRECTION
The correction (in latitude and longitude) that must be applied to the projection lines on a survey sheet or chart to
transform it to a different datum.

DATUM PLANE
A vertical control datum. Although a level surface is not a plane, the vertical control datum is frequently referred
to as the datum plane.

DAYBEACON
An unlighted structure which serves as a daytime aid to navigation by virtue of its distinctive appearance which
makes it recognizable and identifiable.

*Page 215*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAY OF YEAR
A sequential numbering system starting with 001 on January 1 of each year and ending with 365, or 366 in leap
years, on December 31 of that year. DOY is often incorrectly referred to as Julian Day.

DAYMARK
The identifying characteristics of an aid to navigation, unique and distinctive to facilitate its daytime recognition.
Also, a conspicuous target added to a daybeacon or light.

DEADHEAD
A submerged or barely awash log or tree trunk freely floating at varying attitudes, in contrast to the plane formed
by the still undisturbed surface of the water. At times, one end of a deadhead may become temporarily attached to
the bottom with the opposite (unattached) end floating in a pivotal or vertical manner due to the action of waves
and/or currents.

DEAD RECKONING
A method of navigation that has been historically used in hydrographic surveying to control the position of the
survey ship beyond the range of control stations, and to supplement astronomic observations. The position is
determined by applying the ship’s run to the last well-determined position, using the course steered and the
distance traveled by the log.

DEADWEIGHT DEPRESSOR
A heavy, inert weight used to increase towfish depth when attached to the tow cable. When using long lengths of
in-water cable, such as when towing lightweight towfish in depths greater than 100 m, drag forces on the cable
often prevent the towbody from descending to the required depth. Slower tow speeds or greater downward pull
at the towbody are required. Although deadweight depressors are more straightforward in application than
hydrodynamic depressors, they should be streamlined and rigged as to be tangle-free during and after deployment.
The use of deadweights also requires greater overside lifting capacity than with hydrodynamic depressors.
DECIBEL
A logarithmic measurement unit that describes a sound’s relative loudness, though it can also be used to describe
the relative difference between two power levels. A decibel (dB) is one tenth of a Bel. In sound, decibels generally
measure a scale from 0 (the threshold of hearing) to 120-140 dB (the threshold of pain). A 3dB difference equates
to a doubling of power. A dB is a unit of measure of signal strength, usually the relation between a transmitted
signal and a standard signal source. Every 3 dB = 50% of signal strength.

DECONFLICT
The process of reconciling conflicting information based on the age of the information, reliability of the source,
etc.

DELTA
The low alluvial land, deposited in a more or less triangular form at the mouth of a river, which is often cut by
several tributaries of the main stream.

DEMARCATION LINE
A line through the high seas marking the allocation of territory between two countries, rather than a boundary
line; for example, the line through the Bering Strait and Bering Sea between Russia and Alaska.

DENSITY OF SOUNDINGS
Intervals between lines of soundings and soundings within the same line. Density of soundings depends heavily
on the scale and nature of the survey and type of sounding equipment used.

*Page 216*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DENSITY OF WATER
Mass per unit volume. The reciprocal of specific volume. In oceanography, the density of sea water is numerically
equivalent to specific gravity and is a function of salinity, temperature, and pressure.

DEPRESSION CONTOUR
A closed contour delimiting an area of lower elevation than the surrounding terrain. Directional ticks extend from
the contour in a downhill direction.

DEPRESSOR
An attachment to a sonar tow cable or towed body that assists in increasing the depths of the towed body; commonly
of two types, deadweight and hydrodynamic. The depressor allows the user to bring a sonar towbody within an
optimum altitude above the seabed. Although lower tow speeds also assist in lowering a towfish, speeds below 1 1.5 knots may produce towbody instability such as kiting and yaw, resulting in data distortions.
DEPTH
The vertical distance from a given water level to the seafloor, lake or river bottom.

DEPTH CONTOUR NAVIGATION
A method of position determination by utilizing the depth curves on the nautical chart. Consists in fitting a series
of observed echo soundings to the depth curves. The line of soundings is fitted to the depth contours by moving it
so that it remains parallel to the true course steered.

DEPTH CURVES
A line on a map, smooth sheet, or nautical chart drawn in accordance with prescribed conventions and generally
connecting points of equal depth at or below a specified datum. The line is sometimes significantly displaced
outside of soundings, symbols, and other chart detail for clarity as well as generalization. Depth curves therefore
often represent an approximate location of the line of equal depth as related to the surveyed line delineated on the
source.

DEPTH UNITS
The units (fathoms, feet, meters) in which the soundings are plotted on the smooth sheet or on the nautical chart.
On early surveys, two depth units were generally used on one survey, but with no uniform dividing line (see
Registry Nos. H-1 (1837) and H-336 (1852)).

DERELICT
A vessel or any property abandoned and afloat within navigable waters and thereby constituting a real or potential
danger to navigation.

DESCRIPTIVE REPORT (DR)
A written report that accompanies every topographic and hydrographic survey for the purpose of supplementing
it with information that cannot be shown graphically thereon, and to direct attention to important results.
DETACHED POSITION (DP)
A discrete geographic position observed and recorded at a specific location. The position is “detached” from the
main scheme of hydrographic sounding lines. Rocks, wrecks, obstructions, aids to navigation, etc., are typically the
sort of features subject to this type of positioning.

DETECTABILITY
The size, shape and makeup of a seabed anomaly, as related to a sonar’s ability to discern its existence. Detection
occurs when excess energy is returned to the sonar transducer from a target or discontinuity. When a target

*Page 217*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

returns this excess energy from only one of many pings, the system will detect the target but the operator may
not recognize it in the data. Some modern sonar data processors are assisting the user in narrowing the gap
between detection and recognition with separate graphic displays of the amplitude of individual return signals.
See Recognition.

DEVIATION
The angle between the magnetic meridian and the axis of a compass card, expressed in degrees east or west to
indicate the direction in which the northern end of the compass card is offset from magnetic north. Deviation is
caused by disturbing magnetic influences in the immediate vicinity of the compass, as within the craft.
DEVIATION OF COMPASS
The deflection of the needle of a magnetic compass due to masses of magnetic metal within a ship on which the
compass is located. This deflection varies with different headings of the ship. The deviation is called easterly and
marked plus (+) if the deflection is to the right of magnetic north, and is called westerly and marked minus (-) if
it is to the left of magnetic north. A deviation table is a tabular arrangement showing the amount of deviation for
different headings of the ship. Each compass requires a separate deviation table.

DIFFERENTIAL GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (DGPS)
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement Global Positioning System that uses a network
of fixed ground based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the satellite
systems and the known fixed positions. These stations broadcast the difference between the measured satellite
pseudoranges and actual (internally computed) pseudoranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudoranges
by the same amount. Differential corrections can be applied in either real time or post-processing.
DIFFERENTIATION
The process of using separate but identical navigational instruments where one is fixed at a known location and
provides, via radio link, a second mobile instrument with offset calculations. This process is used to increase the
accuracy of certain navigational instruments that may be affected by diurnal or atmospheric variations, such as
LORAN, and those with inherent errors, such as GPS.

DIGITAL CARTOGRAPHIC FEATURE FILE (DCFF or CFF)
National Geodetic Survey’s deliverable file that stores geometry and attribute information for spatial features in a
vector data set. The previous file formats included Standard Digital Data Exchange Format and ArcInfo Interchange
file (E00). The current format is the ESRI Shapefile using the Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table
(C-COAST) attribution schema.

DIGITAL MAP (DM)
The National Geodetic Survey’s Coastal Mapping Program’s series identifier for shoreline data contained within
the Digital Cartographic Feature File (DCFF) used from 1990 to 1999. The file identifiers consisted of two alpha
and five numeric characters. The alpha characters were DM, which reflect Digital Map while the numbers ranged
from DM10000 to DM10404.

DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL
A surface, typically land or seafloor, represented in digital form by an elevation grid or lists of three-dimensional
coordinates.

DIKE A bank of earth or stone used to form a barrier, frequently and confusingly interchanged with levee. A dike
restrains water within an area that is normally flooded.

*Page 218*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DILUTION OF POSITION (DOP)
A measure of the geometry of the satellites seen by the receiver. DOP relates the statistical accuracy of the satellite
measurements to the statistical accuracy of the computed solution. Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) is a
common measure, composed of Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) and Vertical Dilution of Precision
(VDOP). Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is composed of Time Dilution of Precision (TDOP) and PDOP.
The larger the DOP, the less accurate the measurement.

DIPFILE
An automated Discrete Independent Point File once maintained within NOAA’s nautical chart program which
listed charting sources and geographic positions of cartographic features, such as navigational aids, landmarks,
wrecks, and obstructions. Elements of the DIPFILE were/are being used in the initial encoding of Electronic
Navigational Charts.

DIRECTION
In surveying and mapping, the angle between a line or plane and an arbitrarily chosen reference line or plane.
DIRECTION LIGHT
A light illuminating a sector of very narrow angle and intended to mark a direction to be followed. A direction
light bounded by other sectors of different characteristics which define its margins with small angles of uncertainty
is called a single station range light.

DISCOLORED WATER
Unnatural colored areas in the sea due to the existence of shoals. Sea water having a color other than the blues and
greens normally seen. Variations of the colors red, yellow, green, and brown, as well as black and white, have been
reported. Discolorations may appear in patches, streaks, or large areas, and may be caused by concentrations of
inorganic or organic particles or plankton.

DISCONTINUITY
In NOAA hydrography, a change in the make-up of a body of water that causes a change in the speed and/or
direction of sound propagation, of an incident sonar pulse. In contrast to an anomaly, which is usually distinct and
separate within the environment, discontinuities are often widespread and difficult to discern as distinct. These
include haline changes in the water, aerated or cavitated bodies of water, and thermoclines.

DISPOSAL AREA
Area designated by the Corps of Engineers for depositing dredged material, where existing depths indicate that
the intent is not to cause sufficient shoaling to create a danger to surface navigation. Disposal areas are shown on
nautical charts. See also dumping grounds, dump site, spoil area.

DIURNAL TIDE
A tide in which the tidal cycle consists of one high water and one low water each tidal day. In British terminology
also called a single day tide.

DOCK
The slip or waterway between two piers, or cut into the land for the berthing of ships. A pier is sometimes
erroneously called a dock.

DOLPHIN
A mooring post or buffer placed at the entrance of a dock, alongside a wharf, or in the middle of a stream. In the
first and second instances it is used as a buffer. In the third, it is used as a mooring post by vessels which discharge
their cargoes without going alongside a dock or wharf. Each dolphin is generally composed of a series of heavy

*Page 219*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

piles contiguous to one another. They are arranged in a circle, brought together, and capped over the top.
DOME
A large rounded hemispherical structure rising from a building or a roof of the same shape.

DOP
See Dilution of Position.

DOPPLER POSITION SYSTEM
A positioning system consisting of a radio receiver at the point whose coordinates are to be determined, one or
more beacons in orbit about the Earth, and a computing system for determining the orbits of the beacons. The
difference between the frequency of a radio wave as received and its frequency as transmitted from the beacon is
a function of the radial velocity of the source with respect to the receiver. Given the ephemeris of the beacon, the
coordinates of the receiver can be calculated from measurements of the difference in frequency.

DOUBTFUL SOUNDING
A depth shown on a chart over a shoal, a rock, etc., that may be less than that indicated, the position not being in
doubt.

DOWNSAMPLING
The process of reducing the number of data points in a data set, generally by keeping shoaler soundings when they
are near deeper soundings. DP See Detached Position. DR See Descriptive Report.

DRAFT
The vertical distance, at any section of a vessel from the surface of the water to the bottom of the keel. When
measured at or near the stem, it is referred to as draft forward and when measured at or near the stern as draft aft.
For a hydrographers, draft refers to the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the transducer face.
DRAG
The hydrodynamic forces exerted on the components of a body in contact with a moving fluid. In the case of a
towed assembly, drag tends to reduce its forward motion.

DREDGED CHANNEL

vessel traffic through coastal shallows.

DRY DOCK
An artificial basin fitted with gate or caisson into which a vessel may be floated and from which the water may be
pumped out to expose the bottom of the vessel.

DRYING HEIGHTS

DUCK BLIND
For agency charting purposes, a duck blind is a non-floating structure, used for concealing waterfowl hunters,
usually consisting of a wooden framework covered with brush. They pose a special problem for the cartographer.
They are essentially unreported to any charting authority when built. They are unlighted and often constructed
in navigable water without regard to the possible hazard they pose, especially to the small craft operator. Many
are substantial structures built on piles. Even after they are eventually reduced to ruins the pilings may persist for
years.

DUMPING GROUNDS
Although shown on nautical charts as dumping grounds in U.S. waters, the federal regulations for these areas have
been revoked and their use for dumping discontinued. These areas will continue to be shown on nautical charts
until such time as they are no longer considered to be a danger to navigation.

DUMP SITE
Area established by federal regulation in which dumping of dredged and fill material and other non-buoyant
objects is allowed with the issuance of a permit. Dump sites are shown on nautical charts.

called a fathogram when not recorded by a Fathometer.

ECHO SOUNDER
An instrument for determining the depth of a body of water or of an object below the surface by measuring the
travel time of an acoustical signal.

ELECTRONIC CHART DISPLAY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (ECDIS)
The navigation information system which is considered the legal equivalent of the nautical chart, displaying selected
information from an electronic navigational chart (ENC) integrated with data from positional and, optionally,
other sensors.

ELECTRONIC CHART SYSTEM (ECS)
A navigation information system that electronically displays vessel position and relevant nautical chart data and
information from the ECS database on a display screen, but does not meet all the IMO requirements for ECDIS
and is not intended to satisfy the SOLAS chapter V requirement to carry a navigational chart.

ELECTRONIC NAVIGATIONAL CHART (ENC)
A vector representation of a nautical chart, intended to be used in conjunction with ECDIS (Electronic Chart
Display and Information Systems). ENC’s are standardized as to content, structure and format and may contain
supplementary nautical information useful for safe navigation.

ELECTRONIC POSITIONING SYSTEM
A positioning system in which the travel time or phase shift of radio waves from fixed points on land was measured.
Short range systems measured travel time of a direct wave using an ultra high frequency (UHF) signal. Medium
range systems measured phase shift of a ground wave that utilized a much lower frequency. These systems were
essentially made obsolete by the advent of GPS in the 1990’s.

ELEVATION MASK
An adjustable feature of GPS receivers that specifies a satellite must be a certain number of degrees above the
horizon before its signals are used for positioning. Satellites at low elevation angles (five degrees or less) have lower
signal strengths and are more prone to loss of lock, thus causing noisy solutions.

ELEVATION
The vertical distance of natural and artificial objects above an adopted reference plane. On nautical/navigational
charts the elevations of bare rocks, bridges, landmarks, and lights are referenced to the plane of mean high water;
contour and summit elevations are referenced to mean sea level, if the source for such information is referenced
to this plane.

ELLIPSOID (or Reference Spheroid)
A mathematical figure generated by the revolution of an ellipse about one of its axes. The ellipsoid that approximates
the geoid is an ellipse rotated about its minor axis. An ellipsoid serves as the mathematical model from which maps
and charts are produced. However, numerous ellipsoids have been developed to support local datums. The use
of the WGS 84 ellipsoid provides a single standard of reference within the Department of Defense. Also called
spheroid of reference, or ellipsoid of reference. See Geoid, Oblate Spheroid, Reference Spheroid.
ELLIPTICITY OF THE SPHEROID
The ratio of the difference between the equatorial (a) and polar (b) radii of the earth (major and minor semi-axes
of the spheroid) and its equatorial radius, or (a-b)/a. Also called flattening of the earth.

EMBANKMENT
An artificial deposit of material that is raised above the natural surface of the land and used to contain, divert, or
store water, to support roads or railways, or for other similar purposes.

EMBAYMENT
Any indentation of a coast, regardless of width, at the entrance or depth of penetration into the land.

*Page 222*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENC VIEWER
Software capable of viewing S-57 format ENC files, i.e., CARIS Easy ENC, Seven C’s, etc.

ENSONIFY
To expose an area, or portion of seabed, to acoustic energy. Seabed that has been covered by sonar, is said to have
been ensonified. Ping rates (numbers of output pulses per second) are often referred to as “ensonification rates.”
EPHEMERIS
The set of parameters used by a global navigation satellite receiver to predict the location of a satellite and its clock
behavior. Each satellite contains and transmits ephemeris data about its own orbit and clock. Ephemeris data is
more accurate than the almanac data, but is applicable over a short time frame from 4 - 6 hr.

EQUIDISTANT MULTIBEAM SONAR SCANNING MODE
The equidistant mode electronically forms the center of each footprint at a uniform distance from each other
across the swath width. This even sampling of across the swath width reduces the amount of overlapping coverage
and intensity of returns in the inner half of the swath in effort to improve resolution in the outer beams. This is
not recommended for hazard investigation surveys because the weak, lower resolution inner beams. Another
disadvantage of this mode is that it reduces the received signal aperture of the outer beams thus reducing the
possibility of detecting distant returns.

EQUIANGULAR MULTIBEAM SONAR SCANNING MODE
The equiangular mode electronically forms the receiving beams in equal angles. This means in the outer beams
the beam footprint increases in length across-track providing bottom coverage across the entire swath width. The
advantage of this mode is the overlapping coverage of the inner half of the swath, excellent for hazard investigation
surveys where precise measurements of small targets are necessary. The primary disadvantage is the lower resolution
in the outer beams. To maintain equal resolution across an entire survey area survey lines must be planned for at
100% overlap (outer beam matching the nadir of the adjacent lines).

ESTIMATED POSITION
The most probable position of a craft determined by incomplete data or data of questionable accuracy. Such a
position might be determined by applying a correction to the dead reckoning position.

ESTUARY
An embayment of the coast in which fresh river water entering at its head mixes with the relatively saline ocean
water. When tidal action is the dominant mixing agent it is usually termed a tidal estuary. Also, the lower reaches
and mouth of a river emptying directly into the sea where tidal mixing takes place. The latter is sometimes called
a river estuary.

EVALUATION REPORT
The successor to the Verifier’s Report, with format and content essentially unchanged. See also Review and Review
Report.

EVENT MARK
A mark or notation put on a sonar record, or embedded in stored data, representing the moment of a navigational
fix or other critical occurrence during a survey. Event marks are important in assessing progress of a survey and
in tying navigation logs to sonar data. Modern computer data processors which geo-code every sonar ping have
simplified the practice of manual log keeping, but event marks are still important as progress references and datarelated geodetic markers.

See Field Examination.

FAIRWAY
That part of a river, harbor, etc., where the main navigable channel for vessels of larger size is located. The usual
course followed by vessels entering or leaving harbor. Also called ship channel. The word “fairway’ has been
generally interpreted to include any navigable water on which vessels of commerce habitually move, and therefore,
embraces the water inside channel buoys where light-draft vessels frequently navigate and not merely the ship
channel itself.

FALSE ORIGIN
A fixed point to the south and west of a grid zone from which grid distances are measured eastward and northward.
Also called a grid origin.

FAST LAND
Land inshore of the inner edge of a marsh; usually at or above the plane of mean high water.

confused with the approximate back limits of marsh or marine vegetation which is normally compiled shoreward
from an apparent shoreline and in lieu of the fast shoreline.

FATHOGRAM
A graphic record of depth measurements obtained by a Fathometer. Frequently, the term is improperly used to
refer to an echogram.

FATHOM
A unit of length equal to 6 ft (1.82880 m), and used principally as a measure of depth of water.

FATHOMETER
Copyrighted trade name for a type of single beam echo sounder. Often incorrectly used to identify any echosounder.

FEDERAL PROJECT DEPTH
The design dredging depth of a channel constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); the project
depth may or may not be the goal of maintenance dredging after completion of the channel. For this reason federal
project depth must not be confused with controlling depth.

obstruction.

FIELD EDIT
The process of on-site examinations and measurements designed to ensure that detail and nomenclature, as
portrayed or described on a previously compiled document, is current, reliable, and adequate for its intended
purpose. The purpose of these documents, which may have been in graphic or tabulated form, was to provide data
for the nautical charting program.

FIELD EXAMINATION (FE)
Hydrographic surveys intended to cover only limited areas. Each survey is assigned a unique registry number the
format of which has varied over time. The original form was F.E. No. (consecutive number by year) (year), for
example, F.E. No. 5 1945. This format was revised in 1980 to FE-(consecutive number), for example, FE-112. The
format was later revised to its present form, F(consecutive number), for example, F0025.

FIELD POSITION
An unadjusted, geographic position of a point on the earth, computed while field work is in progress to determine
the acceptability of the observations or to provide a preliminary position for other purposes.

FIELD SHEET
The system CARIS HIPS and SIPS uses for organizing data products created from cleaned and processed bathymetry
and side scan data. The field sheet consists of a data directory with a field sheet definition file and a CARIS file for
storing vector products. The definition file contains information about the geographic boundary of the field sheet
and the coordinate system to be used for the data products. (Former use: The hydrographer’s or topographer’s
work sheet; the fieldsheet presents a graphic display of all surface and subsurface features in the
area.)
FIGURE OF THE EARTH

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRMWARE
Coded instructions related to processor function, and sometimes data processing algorithms, embedded as integral
portions of the internal circuitry of an electronic system.

FIRST BOTTOM RETURN
The component of a side scan sonar record representing the shortest acoustic path between the towfish and the
seabed directly below the towfish. The first bottom return is utilized by many sonar systems to determine fish
height (altitude), which is important in the algorithms used for range compression correction. In uncorrected
data, the operator will use the first bottom return as a measure of fish height for winch in/out commands to
maintain proper towing altitudes. This feature of the sonar display will be very strong in hard bottom or over a
rocky substrate, but may be difficult to discern over a mud or silt seabed.

FIRST SURFACE RETURN
The component of a side scan sonar record representing the shortest acoustic path between the towfish and the
surface directly above the towfish. Because the vertical beamwidth is very wide in side scan sonar, some of the
acoustic energy propagates upwards from the transducer. Although this energy is very low level, the sea surface
can be a good reflector and return enough of the incident pulse to be noticeable in data. As the fish is lowered, the
first surface return moves, in the water column portion of the record, away from the centerline. In shallow water
operations, as the fish is lowered past the half-depth point, this return becomes lost in the near range data. Beyond
this it may not be discernible because of its low signal strength. In shallow water, when the first surface return
crosses the first bottom return, the towfish is halfway between the surface and the seabed.

FISH HAVEN
An area established by private interests, usually sport fishermen, to simulate natural reefs and wrecks that attract
fish. The reefs are constructed by dumping assorted material in areas which may be of very small extent or may
stretch a considerable distance along a depth contour. Fish havens have defined authorized boundaries and
minimum clearances, both of which are shown on nautical charts.

FISH HEIGHT
The distance between a side scan sonar towfish and the seabed, usually measured in feet or meters.
FISH TRAP
A device for catching fish. It usually consists of stakes and nets arranged such that fish entering are prevented from
exiting.

FISH TRAP AREA
An area established by the Corps of Engineers in which traps may be built and maintained according to established
regulations. The fish stakes which may exist in these areas are obstructions to navigation and may be dangerous.
The limits of fish trap areas and a cautionary note are usually charted.

FIX
A position determined without reference to any former position. In concept, a fix is the common intersection of
two or more lines of position obtained from simultaneous observations not dependent upon any former position.
In normal practice, a fix is the most probable position derived from 2 or more intersecting lines of position obtained
from observations made at nearly the same time.

ramp that rests upon the dock on rollers, to adjust for the vertical movement of the dock. The dock is usually
held in place by vertical poles embedded in the soil under the water or by anchored cables. 2. A form of dry dock
consisting of a floating structure of one or more sections which can be partly submerged by controlled flooding to
receive a vessel, then raised by pumping out the water so that the vessel’s bottom can be exposed.
FLOOD
The movement of a tidal current toward the shore or up a tidal river or estuary.

FOLIO CHARTS

jacket.

FOOTPRINT
The area of seabed ensonified by an outgoing sonar beam during, or after, a specific period of time. A smaller
footprint of sonar on the seabed will result in a higher resolution image in the data.

FORELAND
A cape or peninsula.

FORESHORE
That part of the shore lying between the crest of the seaward berm (or the upper limit of wave wash at high tide)
and the ordinary low-water mark According to riparian law, the strip of land between the high- and low-water
marks that is alternatively covered and uncovered by the flow of the tide.

FORMLINE
Broken lines resembling contour lines but representing no actual elevations, which have been sketched from visual
observation or from inadequate or unreliable map sources, to show collectively the shape of the terrain rather than
the elevation.

*Page 227*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOUL AREA
1. An area where numerous hazards to navigation may cause damage to vessels entering or transiting the area.
2. An area in which hazardous rocks or other obstructions are too numerous to be located individually during a
hydrographic survey or cartographically depicted individually. Such areas shall be delimited by a surveyed dashed
line. Unless annotated otherwise, a note “foul” within such a delimited area will be construed as foul with rocks.
The term “foul” should not be applied to a soft continuum with indefinite boundaries such as mud or sand; to
areas congested with marine vegetation such as kelp or grass in water; or to materials not likely to cause damage
to a vessel.

FOUL BERTH
A berth in which a vessel cannot swing to her anchor or moorings without fouling another vessel or striking an
obstruction.

FOUL BOTTOM
A hard, uneven, rocky, or obstructed bottom having poor holding qualities for anchors, or one having rocks or
wreckage that would endanger an anchored or transiting vessel.

FOUL GROUND
An area where the holding qualities for an anchor are poor, or where danger of striking or fouling the ground or
other obstructions exist. Examples would be areas strewn with rocks, boulders, coral or obstructions.
FRINGING ISLANDS

FRINGING REEF
A reef attached to and paralleling a shore.

7.7 G
------

GAIN
A measure of the increase in signal amplitude produced by an amplifier. In sonar applications, gains are most often
applied in two ways. One is time-varied-gain (TVG), where signal amplification increases as a function of time.
This methodology can be applied because there is a constant speed of sound underwater for most sonar applications
and the returning signal level from the seabed decreases as the pulse travels across the seabed and away from the
transducer. Closer returns have a far higher intensity than distant ones. The other method of increasing gains in
sonar is to apply them to the display only. In hard copy recorders, printer gain will darken the record, and with
computerized sonar processors, increasing video intensity has a similar effect.

GAUSSIAN ERROR
Deviation of a magnetic compass due to transient magnetism which remains in a vessel’s structure for short periods
after the inducing force has been removed. This error usually appears after the vessel has been on the same heading
for a considerable time.

GENERAL CHARTS
Nautical charts which are published at scales from 1:150,001 to 1:600,000 and are intended for coastal navigation
when a course is well offshore but can be fixed by landmarks, lights, buoys, and characteristic soundings.

*Page 228*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the earth with respect to the reference spheroid. Also imprecisely called geographic coordinates.
GEODETIC DATUM
The adopted position in latitude and longitude of a single point to which the charted features of a vast region are
referred. It consists of five quantities; the latitude and longitude of the point; the azimuth of a line from this point to
another point to which it is tied by the triangulation; and two constants necessary to define the terrestrial spheroid.
ELLIPSOID HEIGHT
The distance from a point to the reference ellipsoid along a line normal to the ellipsoid. The difference between a
point’s ellipsoid height and its orthometric height equals the geoidal height.

GEODETIC POSITION
A position of a point on the surface of the earth expressed in terms of geodetic latitude and geodetic longitude. A
geodetic position implies an adopted geodetic datum.

GEODETIC SURVEY
A survey in which the figure and size of the Earth is considered. It is applicable for large areas and long lines and
is used for the precise location of basic points suitable for controlling other surveys.

GEOGRAPHIC CELL (GC)
The current National Geodetic Survey’s Coastal Mapping Program’s series identifier for shoreline data contained
within the Digital Cartographic Feature File (DCFF). Geographic Cells replaced the DM series of DCFFs which
superseded the registry numbers (e.g. T and TP) used to identify topographic survey manuscripts. The GC series
identifier consists of two alpha and five numeric characters. The alpha characters are “GC” for Geographic Cells
while the five numeric characters are a continuation of the DM series numbers (GC10405 being the first GC).

The actual geoid is an equipotential surface to which, at every point, the plumb line (direction in which gravity
acts) is perpendicular. Geoids currently in use are GEOID84 and GEOID90.

GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS)
A constellation of 24 satellites operated by the U.S. Department of Defense which orbit the earth at a very high
altitude. GPS satellites transmit signals that allow one to determine, with great accuracy, the locations of GPS
receivers. The receivers can be fixed on the Earth, in moving vehicles, aircraft, or in low-Earth orbiting satellites.
GPS is used in air, land and sea navigation, mapping, surveying and other applications where precise positioning
is necessary. GPS can provide highly accurate position and velocity information in three dimensions and precise
time and time interval on a global basis continuously.

GRAPHIC SCALE

mixture of these with sand.

GRAZING ANGLE
The angle at which a sonar pulse strikes, and propagates across, the seafloor. The grazing angle of the sonar pulse
has an effect on the reverberation or backscatter of the ensonified seabed. Grazing angle algorithms in side scan
sonar systems attempt to compensate for these changes and produce a uniform image in the sonar data.
GREENWICH MEAN TIME (GMT)
Mean solar time at the meridian of Greenwich, England. It has been used as a basis for standard time throughout
the world. Also called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

initial or zero of longitudes for all nations.

GRID
A series of lines, usually straight and parallel, or two sets of mutually perpendicular lines, dividing a map, chart, or
other representation of the earth’s surface into squares or rectangles to permit the location of any point by a system
of rectangular coordinates or to serve as a directional reference for navigation. A grid is not necessarily a graticule,
and the terms should not be used interchangeably.

GRIDDING
A process used to thin dense hydrographic data by determining a depth at a “grid node” (intersection point of
perpendicular grid lines) by considering points in proximity to that grid node – usually a radial distance.
GROIN
A low artificial wall-like structure of durable material extending from the land to seaward for a particular purpose,
such as to protect the coast or to force a current to scour a channel. Groins may be classified as permeable or

Of a particular LORAN-C chain, the specified time interval for all stations of the chain to transmit their pulse
groups. For each chain a minimum group repetition interval (GRI) is selected of sufficient duration to provide
time for each station to transmit its pulse group and additional time between each pulse group so that signals
from two or more stations cannot overlap in time anywhere within the coverage area. The GRI is normally stated
in terms of tens of microseconds, i.e., the GRI having a duration of 79,900 microseconds is stated as 7990. In
providing means for identifying a chain within a system all stations of which transmit on the same frequency (100
kHz), the GRI is the chain signature.

California, for example.

GULF COAST LOW WATER DATUM (GCLWD)
A tidal datum used as chart datum for the coastal waters of the Gulf coast of the United States from November 14,
1977to November 27, 1980. GCLWD is defined as mean lower low water (MLLW) when the type of tide is 28, 1980
by the National Tidal Datum Convention of 1980.

7.8 H
------

HCell
The S-57 map in CARIS HOM containing all of the new survey and chart information necessary for updating or
creating a new ENC and chart product. The CARIS map is referred to as an HCell at any stage in CARIS HOM
processing.

HCell DELIVERABLE
The S-57 Base Cell File (*.000) exported and converted to charting units in HOM.

H DRAWING
Compiled drawing of the nautical chart reflecting revisions based upon source data, such as hydrographic surveys
or other sources.

H SURVEY
Refers to a Basic Hydrographic Survey because registry numbers for Basic Hydrographic Surveys begin with the
letter “H”. A basic survey is one that is so complete and thorough it does not need to be supplemented by other
surveys.

HACHURES
Short lines or wedge shaped marks on topographic maps or nautical charts to indicate the slope of the ground or
the submarine bottom. They usually follow the direction of the slope. Hachures may be used to identify a steep
coast, but unlike contours they do not show degree of slope or actual elevation of ground above chart datum. They
may also be used to accentuate a spot elevation on very small-scale charts without contours.

HAND LEAD
A light sounding lead (7 to 14 pounds), usually having a line of not more than 25 fm.

HARBOR
A place where ships may find shelter. A harbor may be natural or artificially constructed. In either case its waters
are inland. The limits of its inland waters are determined, at least in part, by their use as a harbor rather than the
mere application of delimitation principles to geography, as is the case with bays and rivers.

HARBOR CHARTS
Nautical charts published at scales of 1:50,000 and larger, and intended for navigating in harbors and smaller
waterways and for anchorage.

HARBOR LINE
Lines prescribed by the Corps of Engineers (USACE), which limit the length of piers and other structures projecting
into navigable channels; the construction of structures channelward of this line is not permitted unless the harbor
lines are modified. Navigation improvements and surveys by the (USACE) do not extend inside (shoreward of)
the harbor lines. Harbor lines are of two types, pierhead lines and bulkhead lines. Bulkhead lines are prescribed
where the waterfront construction is of a solid nature, such as marginal wharves, backfilled seawalls and bulkhead
wharves; the water areas inside bulkhead lines normally may be filled in by private concerns upon proper application
to the USACE. Pierhead lines are associated with open-type construction, such as open pile piers, and no such
structure may extend channelward of these lines. For waterfronts where both types of construction occur, both

*Page 232*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lines will be prescribed. Harbor lines are usually straight line-segments crossing the outermost pierheads and/or
bulkhead facilities, and are marked with accurately located, permanent monuments so that local surveyors may
easily locate them.

HARBOR OF REFUGE
A harbor provided as a temporary refuge on a stormy coast for the convenience of passing shipping. It may or may
not be part of a shipping port. Also called port of refuge. HDAPS Stands for Hydrographic Data Acquisition and
Processing System. Antiquated hydrographic acquisition and processing software used during the late 1980s and
obsolete by the mid-1990s.

HDOP (HORIZONTAL DILUTION OF PRECISION)
The horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) allows one to more precisely estimate the accuracy of GPS horizontal
(latitude/longitude) position fixes by adjusting the error estimates according to the geometry of the satellites used.
In probability terminology, HDOP is an additional variable that allows one to replace the overall accuracy estimates
with conditional accuracy for the given HDOP value.

HEAD
A steep cape or peninsula.

HEADING
The horizontal direction in which a ship actually points or heads at any instant, expressed in angular units from
a reference direction, usually from 000° at the reference direction clockwise through 360°. Heading is often
designated as true, magnetic, compass, or grid, as the reference direction is true, magnetic, compass, or grid north,
respectively. Heading should not be confused with course, which is the intended direction of movement through
the water. At a specific instant the heading may or may not coincide with the course, depending upon such factors
as steering errors, actions of the seas upon the ship, etc. The heading of a ship is also called Ship’s Head.
HEADLAND
1. In common usage, a land mass having a considerable elevation. In the context of the Law of the Sea, elevation
is not an important attribute and a headland may be the apex of a salient of the coast, the point of maximum
extension of a portion of the land into the water, or a point on the shore at which there is an appreciable change
in direction of the general trend of the coast. 2. A geographic feature that serves to give an inland water body its
landlocked nature. A headland may be natural or man-made. It must be above mean low water but not by any
significant extent. It will usually provide an appreciable change in the direction of the coast.

HEAVE
The oscillatory rise and fall of a ship due to the entire hull being lifted by the force of the sea. The disjointed, jagged
images on a sonar record produced by heave. Heave is a major cause of data distortion. Heave compensators are
used on vessels to remove the effect of this motion from the recorded seabed profile. Also applies to the rhythmic
up and down movement of a towfish in moderate to heavy seas. Under some conditions, longer tow cables will
dampen the effect of heave affecting towfish but can also result in a harmonic effect, increasing the heave.
HIGH SEAS
The open sea beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone, the territorial sea or the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic
country.

HIGH WATER
The maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high water is caused by the periodic tidal forces and the effects
of meteorological, hydrologic, and/or oceanographic conditions. For tidal datum computational purposes, the
maximum height is not considered a high water unless it contains a tidal high water.

*Page 233*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH WATER LINE
1. The intersection of the land with the water surface at an elevation of high water. 2. A generalized term associated
with the tidal plane of high water, but not with a specific phase of high water, such as higher high water or lower
high water.

HIGH WATER MARK
A line or mark left upon tide flats, beach, or alongshore objects indicating the elevation of the intrusion of high
water. The mark may be a line of oil or scum on alongshore objects, or a more or less continuous deposit of fine
shell or debris on the foreshore or berm. This mark is physical evidence of the general height reached by wave
runup at recent high waters. It should not be confused with the mean high water line or mean higher high water
line.

HIPS VESSEL FILE (HVF)
A file generated in CARIS software used to set the parameters for sensors and other equipment for data processing.
Previously referred to as a Vessel Configuration File (VCF).

HISTORY SHEET
See Chart History.

HOLDING GROUND
An expression usually used with a modifying adjective to indicate the quality of the holding power of the material
constituting the bottom of an anchorage; e.g., of good (or poor) holding power.

HOLIDAY
An unintentionally unsurveyed area within a given hydrographic survey project, where the spacing between
soundings, sounding lines, or surveys exceeds the maximum allowable limits.

HOOK
Something resembling a hook in shape, particularly (a) a spit or narrow cape of sand or gravel which turns landward
at the outer end, or (b) a sharp bend or curve, as in a stream.

HORIZONTAL BEAM WIDTH
The angle of the transmitted (and/or received) sonar beam in the along-track (transverse) dimension. Narrow
horizontal beamwidths increase transverse resolution. Because beamwidth is related to transducer length and
frequency, beamwidth decreases with increasing frequency for a given transducer length.

HORIZONTAL CONTROL
Historically, a network of stations of known geographic or grid positions referred to a common horizontal datum,
which control the horizontal position of mapped features with respect to parallel and meridians, or northing and
easting grid lines shown on the map. Horizontal control includes basic (marked) and supplementary (unmarked)
stations.

HORIZONTAL CONTROL STATION
A station whose position has been accurately determined in x and y grid coordinates, or latitude and longitude.
Also called horizontal control point.

HORIZONTAL DATUM
1. At its most basic level of definition, the horizontal datum is a collection of specific points on the Earth that have
been identified according to their precise northerly or southerly location (latitude), and their easterly or westerly
location (longitude).

*Page 234*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. A reference system for specifying positions on the Earth’s surface. Each datum is associated with a particular
reference spheroid that can be different in size, orientation, and relative position from the spheroids associated
with other horizontal datums. Positions referred to different datums can differ by several hundred meters.
HPS

portion of the hulk is usually visible at some stage of tide.

HYDRO HOT LIST
A list, maintained by CO-OPS, of water level stations which are currently providing data for NOAA hydrographic
surveys. If a station is on the Hydro Hot List, the gauge’s data is carefully monitored and its processing is given
priority over other gauges.

HYDRODYNAMIC DEPRESSOR
A tow assembly depressor designed with vanes or a wing oriented in such a way as to increase negative lift when
exposed to an increased water flow. Hydrodynamic depressors work by increasing the downward pull on the
towbody end of the cable during towing. The advantage of this kind of depressor is that they are lightweight and
relatively easy to deploy. Some types can be rigged to invert and increase drag if they come in contact with the
seabed, thus rapidly bringing the towfish to altitude and out of collision danger. They must be rigged carefully
so as to be tangle-free during and after deployment. A disadvantage to the hydrodynamic depressor is that an
increase in towspeed will not raise the towfish to avoid an obstruction. It may, instead, bring it deeper. Another
disadvantage to this type of depressor is that it typically requires significant towspeeds to develop effectiveness.
HYDROGRAPHER
One who studies and practices the science of hydrography. The term is capitalized when referring to the person in
charge of a hydrographic department or office of a country.

HYDROGRAPHIC DATA CLEANING SYSTEM (HDCS)
CARIS’s acronym for their Hydrographic Data Cleaning System. The HDCS data format uses the Project/Vessel/
Day/Line (PVDL) hierarchical structure to store the information.

HYDROGRAPHIC MANUALS
The form of publication used by NOAA since 1928 for providing instructions for hydrographic work. Four
suchmanuals have been issued to date – in 1928, 1942, 1960, and 1976.

HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY
A survey having for its principal purpose the acquisition of data relating to a body of water for the purpose of
promoting safe navigation. A hydrographic survey may consist of or require one or several of the following classes
of data: depth of water; configuration and nature of the bottom; velocity of currents; heights and times of tides and
water levels; location of aids and dangers to navigation; configuration of marginal land areas; and determination of
magnetic declination and anomalies for navigating by magnetic compass. Information on geographic names and
harbor facilities may also be documented.

HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY EXAMINATION
Consequent to a formal policy transferring responsibility for hydrographic survey quality and final approval to
the then Office of Marine Operations, the quality control of all hydrographic survey products was discontinued
in October, 1982. Instead, procedures and policies were established to conduct quality control examinations on a

*Page 235*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

statistically representative sample consisting of not more than 10% of products. This examination was identified
as a Hydrographic Survey Examination and was approximately equivalent to the preparation of a Quality Control
Report. However, it differed from the quality control examination in that the effort was directed toward evaluating
compliance with, and the adequacy of, standards, rather than a careful examination of the data and their quality.
Each survey selected was carefully examined by a cartographer for adequacy with respect to data acquisition and
conformance with applicable standards and project instructions. In addition, the overall condition of the records
and the descriptive report were reviewed. The digital data representing the survey was plotted and subjected to
a cursory examination to determine the degree of compliance with digital data standards. The examination was
limited to only that necessary to evaluate the acquisition and processing procedures.

HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY GUIDELINES
A discontinued series of guidelines initiated in 1979 to emphasize, interpret, and supplement material contained
in the NOAA Hydrographic Manual, Fourth Edition, and various other publications and memorandums. The
Guidelines were intended primarily for communication of processing techniques between the Hydrographic
Surveys Division and the Marine Centers.

HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY SHEET
An inclusive term used to designate boat sheets, field sheets, and smooth sheets.

HYDROGRAPHY
The branch of applied science which deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of the
navigable portion of the Earth’s surface and adjoining coastal areas, with special reference to their use for the
purpose of navigation.

HYDROPHONE
A sonar receiver functioning by transforming underwater sound signals (pressure waves) into electrical signals.
Often a hydrophone is a passive device doing no transmitting on its own.

HYPERBOLIC POSITIONING SYSTEM
A positioning system in which the observer measures the difference in time of reception of signals from two
stations whose coordinates are known. The difference in time is converted to a difference in distance. The locus
of all points lying at a fixed difference in distance from two points are the two branches of a hyperbola. There is
usually a third station operating in conjunction with one of the two to provide the observer with another difference
in distance and another pair of hyperbola branches. The observer is at one of the intersections of the branches.
LORAN is the oldest known positioning system using this technique.

IKONOS
The Ikonos-2 satellite was launched in September, 1999, and has been delivering commercial data since early 2000.
Ikonos is the first of the next generation of high spatial resolution satellites. Ikonos data records 4 channels of multispectral data at 4 m resolution, and 1 panchromatic channel with 1 m resolution. This means that Ikonos was the
first private-sector satellite to deliver near-photographic high-resolution satellite imagery of objects or specified
locations anywhere in the world, e.g., shorelines. Ikonos-2 is equipped with a Kodak digital camera. This payload
will enable the satellite to collect 1-m resolution panchromatic (gray-scale) resolution and 4-m resolution, 4-band
multi-spectral (red, green, blue, near infrared) imagery of the Earth. The camera is comprised of a Kodak-designed
and -manufactured focal plane array and a lightweight telescope using a state-of-the-art mirror fabricated with
Kodak’s advanced ion-figuring technology. To speed the downloading of data to Space Imaging EOSAT’s ground
receiving stations, the original 11-bit data will be compressed using Kodak’s proprietary bandwidth compression
technology.

IMPROVED CHANNELS
Dredged channels under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and maintained to provide an
assigned controlling depth. Symbolized on the nautical/navigational charts by black, dashed lines to represent the
side limits, with the controlling depth and date of ascertainment; sometimes accompanied by a tabulation for more
detailed information.

INERTIAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
A positioning system consisting of a computer and an assemblage of three accelerometers and two or three
gyroscopes. The gyroscopes are fastened together in such a way that they define the orientation of the accelerometers
with respect to non-rotating coordinates and the accelerometers measure the components of acceleration of the
positioning system along the directions defined by the gyroscopes. The computer and associated equipment
integrate the components of acceleration to give the 3 components of displacement of the positioning system.
INFORMATION AWOIS ITEM
An AWOIS item for which no search radius has been assigned. If the item is detected in the course of hydrography,
develop to fullest extent.

INLAND RULES OF THE ROAD
Rules to be followed by all vessels while navigating upon certain inland waters of the U.S. See also Colregs.
INLAND WATER LINE
A series of straight lines developed by the Coast Guard to separate areas that are subject to its Inland Rules of the
Road from those to which the International Rules apply. The lines have no bearing on inland water determinations
for Convention of Submerged Lands Act purposes.

INLAND WATERS
Waters landward of the baseline from which the marginal seas are measured and over which complete sovereignty
is exercised. Specific information is contained within 33 U.S.C. Chapter 3. Also known as “internal waters.”
INLET
1. A narrow strip of water running into the land or between islands. 2. An arm of the sea (or other body of water)
that is long compared to its width, and that may extend a considerable distance inland.

INNER HARBOR
The part of a harbor more remote from the sea, as contrasted with the outer harbor. These expressions are usually
used only in a harbor that is clearly divided into two parts, as by a narrow passageway or man-made structures.
The inner harbor generally has additional protection and is often the principal berthing area.

*Page 237*

INS
See Integrated Navigation System.

INSET
In cartography: (a) a small area outside the neat lines of a map or chart included within the neat lines or borders
to avoid publishing a separate graphic of the small area alone; (b) a representation of a small area on a larger scale
(e.g., town-plan inset), or of a large area at a smaller scale (e.g., orientation inset); (c) any information, not normally
appearing within the geographic limits of a map, which has been enclosed by border lines and included within the
map neat lines. Insets are always placed in areas where important features will not be covered. See Subplan.
INSHORE
1. In beach terminology, the zone of varying width extending from the low water line through the breaker zone.
2. In NOAA operational hydrography terminology, the zone extending shoreward from depths of 8 m.

INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Most commonly, a computer-based navigation system deployed on large vessels. INS systems have one or more
displays and take input from a navigational device such as a GPS receiver and display the ship’s track, course, and
heading on a screen. Modern units allow the user to log targets, filter errant position fixes, log the ship’s position
history, display user-defined lines the ship is to follow, and display shorelines.

INTERFERENCE
The display of erroneous signals from acoustic or electrical sources that conflict with the display of the primary
sonar data. Interference can be internal to the sonar system, but is most commonly from other sources. Causes of
external interference include generator noise, electromagnetic radiation from other electronics, ship’s engines and
propellers, flow noise, and noise from biological sources. See Noise.

INTERFEROMETRIC SONAR
A system based on the process by which two or more sonar waves of the same frequency combine to reinforce
or cancel each other, the amplitude of the resulting wave being equal to the sum of the amplitudes of each of the
combining waves. Because the angle of interference can be determined, these sonar systems provide bathymetric
information over a wide swath.

INTERNATIONAL CHART
One of a coordinated series of small-scale charts for planning and long range navigation. The charts are prepared
and published by different Member States of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) using the same
specifications.

INTERNATIONAL GREAT LAKES DATUM 1985 (IGLD)
A vertical control datum having its zero horizontal plane at mean sea level at Rimouski, Quebec, as determined
from measurements at Rimouski/Pointe-au-Pere over the period 1982-1988. It is used primarily for the definition
of the chart datum, Low Water Datum, in each of the Great Lakes, their connecting waterways, and the St. Lawrence
River, and for hydraulic studies of the same. IGLD (1985) was implemented, effective January 1992, replacing the
old International Great Lakes Datum (1955).

INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC BUREAU (IHB)
An organization founded in 1921 for the purpose of establishing a close and permanent association among
hydrographic offices of its 19 Member States. The Bureau was provided with headquarters in the Principality of
Monaco by H.S.H. Prince Albert I of Monaco, a noted marine scientist. In 1970, an intergovernmental Convention
entered into force which changed the organization’s name and legal status, creating the International Hydrographic
Organization (IHO), with its headquarters (the IHB) permanently established in Monaco.

*Page 238*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO)
An intergovernmental consultative and technical organization that traces its origin to 1921 and was established to
support safety in marine navigation and the protection of the marine environment. The main objectives of the IHO
is to bring about the coordination of the activities of national hydrographic offices, the greatest possible uniformity
in nautical charts and documents, the adoption of reliable and efficient methods of carrying out and exploiting
hydrographic surveys, the development of the sciences in the field of hydrography and the techniques employed
in descriptive oceanography.

INTERNATIONAL NAUTICAL MILE
In 1929, the International Hydrographic Conference in Monaco defined the international nautical mile as exactly
1,852 m, about 6,076.11549 ft.

INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY
An approximately 3,000 mile-long, partly natural, partly artificial, waterway, providing sheltered passage for
commercial and leisure boats along the U.S. Atlantic coast from Boston, MA to Key West, in southern FL, and
along the Gulf of Mexico coast from Apalachee Bay, in NW FL, to Brownsville, TX, on the Rio Grande. The tollfree waterway, authorized by Congress in 1919, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at a minimum
depth of 12 ft (4 m) for most of its length; some parts have 7-ft (2.1-m) and 9-ft (2.7-m) minimum depths. The
Intracoastal Waterway has a good deal of commercial activity; barges haul petroleum, petroleum products,
foodstuffs, building materials, and manufactured goods. [From: The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.

ISLAND
mean high water; an area of dry land entirely surrounded by water or a swamp; an area of swamp entirely surrounded
by open water.

ISLET

7.10 J
-------

JETTY
A substantial, artificial structure erected on the coast for the purpose of extending the flow of a river or protecting
a harbor or beach.

JULIAN DAY
The consecutive number of each day commencing January 1, 4713 B.C. The Julian day begins at noon, 12 hours
later than the corresponding civil day. For example, the day beginning at noon January 1, 1968 was Julian day
2,439,857. This term is often incorrectly used when referring to the sequential 3-digit day number of the year. The
sequential 3-digit day number of the year should be referred to as the “day of year” or “day number” rather than
as the “Julian Day.”
JUNCTION
A place of meeting or joining. In hydrographic surveying, the joining of two or more adjacent/adjoining survey
sheets.

*Page 239*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JUNCTION BUOY
A buoy which, when viewed from a vessel approaching from the open sea or in the same direction as the main
stream of flood current, or in the direction established by appropriate authority, indicates the place at which two
channels meet. Also referred to as a Bifurcation Buoy.

7.11 K
-------

KAPP
A unique number assigned to each chart panel, inset, or extension of all agency nautical charts. See Chapp.
KELP
An order of usually large blade-shaped or vine-like brown algae that grows on rocky bottoms and is therefore
associated with possible dangers to navigation.

KEY
See Cay.

KINEMATIC SURVEYING
Kinematic surveying is a method of surveying with GPS that initially solves wavelength ambiguities and retains
the resulting measurements by maintaining a lock on a specific number of satellites throughout an entire surveying
period. Observations are made while a receiver is in motion. In surveying applications, kinematic refers to
uninterrupted carrier-phase measurements following successful solution of the integer ambiguities. This can be
accomplished in a continuous mode where the receiver remains in motion for precise positioning of a vehicle,
or in an intermittent mode where data is recorded only after a receiver is brought to a stationary point, and the
observations while in motion are tracked as a way to maintain the integer ambiguities.

KITING
A rhythmic, lateral movement experienced by tow bodies on long cables and in deep water; most often induced
by poor hydrodynamics of a depressor. The proper application of depressors is important to maintain reliable fish
stability. One depressor shape and form may work well at only certain speeds, while creating instabilities at others.
Kiting is one of a variety of instabilities that can be recognized in sonar data.

KNOT
A unit of speed defined (1978) as 1 international nautical mile per hour. It was previously defined as 1 nautical mile
per hour, but this led to confusion because the American and British nautical miles differ by 1.184 m. The knot is
equal to 1.852 km/hr.

7.12 L
-------

LAGOON
A shallow body of water which usually has a shallow restricted inlet from the sea.

LAKE
Any standing body of inland water, generally of considerable size. There are exceptions, such as the lakes in
Louisiana which are open to or connect with the Gulf of Mexico. Occasionally, a lake is called a sea, especially if
very large and composed of salt water.

*Page 240*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAMBERT CONFORMAL CONIC PROJECTION

point outside the limits of the map, and the parallels are concentric arcs of circles having the common point as
center.

LAND
The solid part of the surface of the earth, as opposed to water as constituting a part of such surface.
LANDING
A place where boats receive or discharge passengers, freight, etc.

LANDMARK
A conspicuous object, natural or man-made, located near or on land, which aids in fixing the position of an
observer.

LARGE NAVIGATIONAL BUOY (LNB)
A large buoy designed to take the place of a lightship, where construction of an offshore light station is not feasible.
These 40-ft diameter buoys may show secondary lights from heights of about 36 ft above the water. In addition to
the light, such buoys may mount a radiobeacon and provide sound signals. A station buoy may be moored nearby.
LARGE SCALE SURVEY (CHART)
A scale involving a relatively small reduction in size. A large scale chart is one covering a small area. The opposite
is small scale. In agency usage, a scale of 1:80,000 would be the upper limit of classification.

LATERAL OFFSET
The position of the towfish off to the side of the surface vessel’s track. This occurs when the surface vessel track is
not aligned with a surface or subsea current. It can also be caused by poor hydrodynamics. The effect of the current
will pull the towfish away from the vessel trackline. In extreme cases, the towfish can also crab into such a current
and result in a loss of data.

LATERAL SYSTEM
A system of aids to navigation in which buoys, daybeacons, and minor lights are assigned colors and shapes in
accordance with their respective location in relation to safe water.

LATTICE
A pattern formed by two or more families of intersecting lines, such as the pattern formed by two or more families
of hyperbolas representing curves of equal time difference associated with a hyperbolic radio navigation system.
Sometimes the term “pattern” is used to indicate curves of equal time difference, with the term “lattice” being used
to indicate its representation on the chart.

LATITUDE
Angular distance from a Primary Great Circle or plane, usually the Equator. One of the coordinates used to describe
a position, the other being longitude.

LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION
The United Nations’ 1982 Convention that, for most purposes, supersedes the four Geneva Conventions of
1958. The “baseline” provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention do not deviate significantly from those of the
Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. The Supreme Court’s adoption of the 1958 principles
for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act is not affected by the new Convention. Entered into force on November

*Page 241*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16, 1994. The United States has recognized most provisions of the 1982 Convention as customary international law
(including the baseline provisions).

LAYBACK
The horizontal distance between the survey vessel, or the navigation antenna, and the towfish. In deep water
towing, this distance is important for positioning features on the seabed and geo-coding sonar data for mosaics.
Because most navigation instruments provide the position of their antenna mounted on the vessel and the “x,
y” origin of the sonar image is at the towfish, this difference in position can be significant. Many methods of
subtracting this distance have been tested using acoustics and algorithms. Acoustic fish positioning methods rarely
work well and often cause more problems than they solve. Algorithms, while not calculating such parameters as
lateral offset, are very accurate in eliminating layback errors.

LEAD
A weight attached to a line. A sounding lead is used for determining depth of water. A hand lead is a light sounding
lead (7 - 14 lbs), usually having a line of not more than 25 fm. A deep sea lead is a heavy sounding lead (about
30 - 100 lbs), usually having a line 100 fm or more in length. A light deep sea lead (30 - 50 lbs), used for sounding
depths of 20 - 60 fm, is called a coasting lead. A type of sounding lead used without removal from the water
between soundings is called a fish lead. A drift lead is one placed on the bottom to indicate movement of a vessel.
To heave the lead is to take a sounding with a lead.

LEAD LINE
A line, graduated with attached marks and fastened to a sounding lead, used for determining the depth of water
when taking soundings by hand. The lead line is usually used in depths of less than 25 fm. Also called a sounding
line.

LEAGUE
A measure of distance, varying for different times and for different countries, from 2.4 - 4.6 miles. In the U.S. it is
considered to be about three miles.

LEAST DEPTH
The minimum depth of a submerged feature. The term is only used when the quality of the sounding meets
existing hydrographic accuracy standards. It is never considered to be an approximate depth.

LEDGE
A rocky formation connected with and fringing the shore, and generally uncovered at the sounding datum. Where
such features exist, the seaward limit of the area that uncovers is usually symbolized on smooth sheets and serves
as a substitute for the zero depth curve.

LEEWARD
The direction toward which the prevailing wind is blowing; the direction toward which waves are traveling.
LEFT BANK
The river bank on the left-hand side as one proceeds downstream.

LEGEND
A description, explanation, table of symbols, and other information, printed on a map or chart to provide a better
understanding and interpretation of it. The title of a map or chart formerly was considered part of the legend, but
this usage is obsolete.

*Page 242*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEVEE
1. An artificial or naturally formed low ridge of material built or deposited along a stream channel or limit areas
subject to flooding. 2. An embankment bordering on one or both sides of a submarine canyon or sea channel,
usually occurring along the outer edge of a curve or meander. See Dike, often incorrectly used interchangeably
with levee.

LEVELING
The process of determining differences of elevation between points on the surface of the earth; the determination
of the elevation of points relative to a vertical datum. Also called differential leveling.

LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging)
An airborne instrument that measures distance to an object by emitting timed pulses of light and measuring the
time between emission and reception of the reflected pulses. The measured time interval is converted into distance.
Topographic LIDAR measures elevations on land. Bathymetric LIDAR uses two different laser frequencies to
measure water depths (one reflects of the water surface and the other off the seafloor). The ability of bathymetric
LIDAR to obtain such depth information is totally dependent on water turbidity but can measure depths of 60
meters in very clear water.

LIGHT
A luminous or lighted aid to navigation.

LIGHTHOUSE
A building on some conspicuous point of the coast, a pier or jetty, an island or rock, from which a light is exhibited at
night as an aid to navigation. All maritime nations have government departments responsible for the establishment
and maintenance of lighthouses.

LIGHT LIST

Coast Guard.

LIGHT LIST NUMBER
The number used to identify a navigational light in the Light List.

LIGHT SECTOR
As defined by bearings from seaward, the sector in which a navigational light is visible or in which it has a distinctive
color different from that of adjoining sectors, or in which it is obscured.

LINE
A course or track, down the center of which a survey vessel travels during a survey. A line is delineated on either
side by half the distance between the current and adjacent tracks. A common method of using sonar to perform
search or survey operations is to set up a series of parallel lines. Represented as imaginary lines on the sea surface,
they may be depicted on a computer screen from an Integrated Navigation System.

LINEAR SCALE
Known in the U.S. as a bar scale. A sub-divided line which shows distances at a given scale. See also Graphic Scale.
LINE FEATURE
A cartographic feature with the geometry of a line, i.e., defined by a sequence of connected points. Represented on
a map by a line of a certain width or type, e.g., dashed, dotted, double, a sequence of symbols. Contrast with point

*Page 243*

feature and area feature.

LINE SMOOTHING
The numerical manipulation of data points (pairs of coordinates) in order to reduce the number or amount of
undulations along a line. May be used to remove irregularities introduced during digitizing, e.g., in case of line
segments which do not join exactly or smoothly enough.

LINE SPACING
The distance between successive parallel vessel tracks in a multi-line survey that are traversed to build a grid to
cover an intended survey area. Line spacing will vary depending upon survey equipment and operational goals.
LITTORAL
Of, or pertaining to, a shore, especially a seashore. Specifically, the various parts of a region bordering the sea,
including the coast, foreshore, backshore, beach, etc.

LOCAL NOTICE TO MARINERS (LNM)
A notification issued at frequent intervals by U.S. Coast Guard districts giving changes and deficiencies in aids to
navigation and other information of navigational importance within the particular district. LNM was historically
a printed document, but is now available only on the U.S. Coast Guard website. Information of a continuing nature
is included in the weekly Notice to Mariners which is issued by NGA.

LOCK
A basin in a waterway with caissons or gates at each end by means of which vessels are passed from one water level
to another without materially affecting the higher level. To lock a vessel means to pass a vessel through a lock.
LOG BOOM
A floating barrier of timber used to protect a river or harbor mouth or to create an enclosed area for storage
purposes.

LONGITUDE
Angular distance, along a Primary Great Circle, from the adopted reference point, usually the Greenwich or prime
meridian. One of the coordinates used to describe a position, the other being latitude.

LORAN
A navigation system developed in the 1950s based on the time displacement between signals from two or more
fixed shore based antennas. Two types of LORAN (an acronym for LOng RAnge Navigation) were developed.
A low resolution LORAN-A was first. Cumbersome and difficult to use, LORAN-A required the user to tune a
receiver and align signal peaks on a scope. A more efficient system, LORAN-C, was developed for use in the 1960s
and provided the user with a readout of numbers representing time differences in microseconds. American charts
were produced with these “TD” lines overprinted on them. Although LORAN-C was very repeatable (often to
within 20 m), the system was not accurately tied to any datum. Further, since the radio transmissions propagated
over land, conversion to latitude and longitude was only approximate, at best. For several decades since the late
1950s, LORAN was the major worldwide land-based navigation system. Offshore beyond the 600-mile range of
these systems, dead reckoning with occasional fixes from transit satellites was a large part of ocean navigation. The
Global Positioning System is expected to completely replace the need for LORAN transmitting stations worldwide.
LOW ORDER STATIONS
A category of control established by ground survey methods that do not meet established Third-Order criteria.
Included are stations positioned through the use of a sextant or planetable, and any station positioned from, or
sighting on, a moving object such that repeat measurements cannot be made.

*Page 244*

Moon and Sun.

LOW-TIDE ELEVATION
A naturally formed area of land surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide. Lowtide
elevations serve as part of the coast line when they are within the breadth of the territorial sea of the mainland or
an island.

LOW WATER
The minimum height reached by a falling tide. The low water is due to the periodic tidal forces and the effects of
meteorological, hydrologic, and/or oceanographic conditions.

LOW WATER DATUM (LWD)
An approximation of mean low water that has been adopted as a standard reference for a limited area and is retained
for an indefinite period regardless of the fact that is may differ slightly from a better determination of mean low
water from a subsequent series of observations. Used primarily for river and harbor engineering purposes.
LOW WATER LINE
The intersection of the land with the water surface at an elevation of low water.

are classified as primary or secondary and are usually manned or remotely monitored.

MANGROVE
For charting purposes, includes the mangroves and stands of tree-like plants that are predominately mangrove.
These plants are perennials that frequently create an apparent shoreline. Much of this vegetation grows in the
vicinity of the high waterline with overhanging and tangled growth that obscures the shoreline. Mangrove is found
in saltwater throughout the tropics.

MAN-MADE SHORELINE
The line of contact between the surface of a body of water and man-made land or features provided the man-made

operation.

MARSH
A tract of soft, wet land, usually vegetated by reeds, grasses and occasionally small shrubs.

MEADES RANCH
A triangulation station established in 1891 in central Kansas which was adopted as the basis for the United States
Standard Datum. The selection was based on the fact that it was near the center of area of the United States and was
common to 2 great arcs of triangulation extending across the country – one along the 39th parallel and the other
along the 98th meridian. The origin or initial point for the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) which was
the regional horizontal coordinate system used throughout the U.S. until 1986.

MEAN HIGHER HIGH WATER (MHHW)
A tidal datum which is the average of the higher high water heights of each tidal day observed over a 19-year
National Tidal Datum Epoch. For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made
with a control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum Epoch.
MEAN HIGH WATER (MHW)
A tidal datum which is the average of all the high water heights of each tidal day observed over a 19-year National
Tidal Datum Epoch. For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made with a
control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum Epoch
MEAN LOWER LOW WATER (MLLW)
A tidal datum which is the average of the lower low water heights of each tidal day observed over a 19-year
National Tidal Datum Epoch. For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made
with a control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum Epoch
MEAN LOW WATER (MLW)
A tidal datum which is the average of all the low water heights of each tidal day observed over a 19-year National
Tidal Datum Epoch. For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made with a
control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum Epoch
MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL)

*Page 247*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

indicated by ranges ashore. It is used by vessels to calibrate logs and engine revolution counters, and to determine
speed.

MERCATOR CHART
A chart on the Mercator Projection. This is the chart commonly used for marine navigation. On a Mercator chart,
a rhumb line is a straight line.

MERCATOR PROJECTION
A Conformal Projection of the cylindrical type. The Equator is represented by a straight line true to scale; the
geographic meridians are represented by parallel straight lines perpendicular to the line representing the Equator;
they are spaced according to their distance apart at the Equator. The geographic parallels are represented by a
second system of straight lines perpendicular to the family of lines representing the meridians, and therefore
parallel with the Equator. Conformality is achieved by mathematical analysis, the spacing of the parallels being
increased with the increasing distance from the Equator to conform with the expanding scale along the parallels
resulting from the meridians being represented by parallel lines. Since Rhumb Lines appear as straight lines and
directions can be measured directly, this projection is widely used in navigation.

MERIDIAN LINE
A north-south line from which longitudes or azimuths are reckoned.

MERIDIANS
A north-south reference line, particularly a great circle through the geographical poles of the earth. Meridians are
measured in degrees east or west of the prime meridian and pass through longitude 0°. See Longitude.
MERIDIONAL PARTS
The length of the arc, expressed in units of 1 min of longitude at the equator, of a meridian between the Equator
and any parallel of latitude on the graticule of the Mercator map projection. See Tables for a Polyconic Projection
of Maps.

METES AND BOUNDS
The boundary lines or limits of a tract of land. One of the oldest methods of describing land and was used to
transfer lands in the Thirteen Original Colonies. Defined variously in law dictionaries as: the boundary lines of
land, with their terminal points and angles; the boundary lines and corners of a piece of land; and the boundary
lines of lands with their terminating points of angles.

MILE
A unit of distance. The nautical mile, or sea mile, is used primarily in navigation. Nearly all maritime nations have
adopted the International Nautical Mile of 1,852 m proposed in 1929 by the International Hydrographic Bureau.
The International Nautical Mile is equivalent to 6076.11549 ft, approximately. The geographical mile is the length
of 1 minute of arc of the equator, considered to be 6,087.08 ft. The statute mile or land mile (5,280 ft in the U.S.) is
commonly used for navigation on rivers and lakes, notably the Great Lakes of North America.

MILEAGE NUMBER
Assigned to aids and gives the distance in sailing miles along the river from a reference point to the aid. Principally
used in the Mississippi River System.

MINIMUM OBSERVED DEPTH
The shallowest depth over a submerged feature obtained during the course of a non-specific investigation. It may
not be the Least Depth but could be reclassified as such following a careful review of the data to determine if it
meets or exceeds current specifications for a basic hydrographic survey.

*Page 248*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MICRO WAVE POSITIONING SYSTEM
A compact, light, and mobile distance measuring system that operates on the basic principle of pulse radar.
A transmitter aboard the survey vessel interrogates transponders at known locations. Elapsed time between
transmitted interrogations and the reply from each transponder is used as the basis for determining range to each
transponder. This range information, together with the known location of each transponder, can be trilaterated to
provide the position of the survey vessel. A widely used type of survey positioning system in the 1970’s through
early 1990’s which was made obsolete by GPS.

MINOR AID TO NAVIGATION
An unmanned, unmonitored light on a fixed structure showing usually low to moderate intensity; generally fitted
with light characteristics and day boards in accordance with its lateral significance in the waterway.
MINUS SOUNDINGS
Soundings that reduce to height above the sounding datum (plane of reference) when corrected for water level.
Minus soundings are shown on the smooth sheet preceded by a minus sign unless they are used to denote the least
depth on a wreck or obstruction. In that case, the sounding is portrayed as an underlined value in parentheses.
A minus sounding has a value above chart datum. For example, chart datum of MLLW would be the 0 contour; a
value of -1 would be 1 ft above MLLW chart datum water line.

MISCELLANEOUS SOURCES
Source information provided by other organizations. Such sources would include the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (formerly known as the National Imagery
and Mapping Agency or NIMA), U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. National Park
Service, and state, local, and foreign government sources.

MIXED TIDES
Tides characterized by a conspicuous diurnal inequality in the higher high and lower high waters and/or the
higher low and lower low waters. Quantitatively, a tide is mixed if the ratio of diurnal tidal constituents K1+O1 to
the semidiurnal constituents M2+S2 is between 0.25 and 3.0.

MODIFIED ROUTE CHARTS
NOS charts that are versions of Intracoastal Waterway charts that were originally issued in a conventional chart
format. They are identical in construction and format to area charts, and are used for some areas not adaptable to
route chart style for long, narrow waterways. See Route Charts.

MOLE
A form of breakwater alongside which vessels may lie on the sheltered side only; in some cases it may lie entirely
within an artificial harbor, permitting vessels to lie along both sides.

MONUMENT
In surveying, a structure used or erected to mark the position of a station; permanence is implied.
MOORING
1. A place where a vessel may be secured. 2. The process of securing a vessel, other than anchoring with a single
anchor.

MOORING BUOY
A buoy secured to the sea floor by permanent moorings and provided with means for mooring a vessel by use of
its anchor chain or mooring lines.

*Page 249*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORAINE
An accumulation of earth, stones, etc., deposited by a glacier, usually in the form of a mount, ridge, or other
prominence on the terrain. In charting, these features often exist at the entrance to or within fjord-like waterways
and, frequently, contain hazardous shoal depths or rocky obstructions.

MOSAIC
An assembly of side scan sonar records matched in such a way as to show a continuous, two-dimensional
representation of an area of seabed.

MOTION REFERENCE UNIT (MRU)
Measures the motion of the vessel or platform, usually Heave, Pitch, and Roll. Yaw is also measured by some MRUs.
MUD FLAT
A muddy, low-lying strip of ground by the shore, or an island, usually submerged more or less completely by the
rise of the tide.

MULTIPATH
As related to echo sounding, sonar signals arriving at a target, or returning to a transducer from a single source
but along different paths. Multipath returns in imaging sonars typically occur in shallow water or around complex
structures, such as petroleum platforms or near piers and pilings. A classic multipath environment for side scan
sonar is in shallow water with a flat sea surface. Acoustic echoes will return to the transducer along 3 different
paths: 1. transducer - target – transducer; 2. transducer - target - sea surface - transducer; and 3. transducer - sea
surface - target - sea surface - transducer. If these 3 return paths take 3 different times, the result will be 3 images
of the same target in the data. As related to navigation systems (e.g., GPS) multipath is the corruption of the direct
GPS signal by reflection from the local surroundings which adversely affects measurements in a GPS receiver.

NARROWS
A navigable narrow part of a bay, strait, river, etc.

NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM of 1929 [NGVD (1929)]
Previously called the Sea Level Datum of 1929, it was a vertical control datum established for vertical control in
the United States by the general adjustment of 1929. The datum was derived for surveys from a general adjustment
of the first-order leveling nets of both the U.S. and Canada. In the adjustment, which was made in 1929, mean sea
level was held fixed as observed at 21 tide stations in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. The datum (was) not mean sea level,
the geoid, or any other equipotential surface. Therefore it was renamed, in 1973, the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum on 1929. This vertical datum was in use until the adoption, in 1991, of the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988 which held fixed the height of the primary tidal bench mark, referenced to the new International Great
Lakes Datum of 1985 local mean sea level height value, at Father Point/Rimouski, Quebec, Canada.

NATIONAL TIDAL DATUM EPOCH (NTDE)
The specific 19-year period adopted by the National Ocean Service as the official time segment over which tide
observations are taken and reduced to obtain mean values (e.g. mean lower low ware, etc.) for tidal datums. It is
the policy of NOS to consider a revised NTDE every 20-25 years in order to take into account relative sea level
changes caused by global sea level change and the effects of long term local land movement due to subsidence or

*Page 250*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

glacial rebound. The present NTDE is 1983-2001. Previous tidal epochs were determined for periods 1924-42,
1941-59, and 1960-78.

NATURAL HARBOR
A harbor possessing natural shelter in a large degree. Natural harbors require only the provision of such facilities
as quays or piers and sometimes deepening by artificial means to make them serviceable as shipping ports.
NATURAL SHORELINE
The line of contact between the surface of a body of water and natural land, including islands. It does not include
the water line along floating or man-made features, or along rocks smaller than those considered to be islands.
NAUTICAL
Of or pertaining to ships, navigation (chiefly marine), or seamen. In contrast, navigational refers to navigation
only; marine refers to the sea; maritime indicates relationship or proximity to the sea; and naval refers to the navy.
NAUTICAL CHART
A representation of a portion of the navigable waters of the earth and adjacent coastal areas on a specified map
projection, and designed specifically to meet requirements of marine navigation. Included on most nautical charts
are: depths of water, characteristics of the bottom, elevations of selected topographic features, general configuration
and characteristics of the coast, the shoreline (usually the mean high water line), dangers, obstruction, aids to
navigation, limited tidal data, and information about magnetic variation in the charted area.

NAUTICAL MILE
A unit of distance used in marine navigation, which may be taken as equal to the length of a minute of arc along
the equator or a minute of latitude on the map which is being measured. Nearly all maritime nations have adopted
the International Nautical Mile of 1,852 m proposed in 1929 by the International Hydrographic Bureau.
See Mile.

NAVIGABLE
Affording passage to a craft; capable of being navigated.

NAVIGABLE AREA LIMIT LINE (NALL)
An alongshore survey line that is also known as a shoreline buffer. The shoreline buffer or NALL should be run
at or near low water prior to acquiring mainscheme hydrography in the near shore area. The shoreline buffer is a
way of providing the hydrographer a “first look” at the near shore detail, which may identify gross discrepancies
in the source or charted shoreline, and reveal significant offshore features that may pose a risk to a survey launch
at higher water.

NAVIGABLE AREA SURVEYS (NAS)
Basic hydrographic surveys with restricted area coverage. By restricting the area of coverage while retaining the
“basic” hydrography concept within surveyed waters, a more rapid progression of field work is realized. The
coverage is typically reduced by omitting requirements for: (1) development of the 0-foot depth curve and (2) foul,
nearshore areas not considered navigable. Navigable Area Surveys may also be restricted to the main navigable
channel or corridor.

NAVIGABLE WATERS
Waters usable, with or without improvements, as routes for commerce in the customary means of travel on water.
NAVIGABLE WATERS OF A STATE
Navigable waterways that lie wholly within the limits of a state and have no navigable connection with any navigable

*Page 251*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

waters outside the boundaries of that state. Such intrastate waters are subject to regulation and control by state laws
and do not fall within the jurisdiction of Congress nor of the laws enacted by it for the preservation and protection
of the navigable waters of the United States.

NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
Waters which form, in their ordinary condition by themselves, or by uniting with other waters, a continuous
highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other states or foreign countries in the customary
modes in which such commerce is conducted by water. This applies also to an artificial canal, even though the
canal is wholly within the body of a state and subject to its ownership and control.

NAVIGATION RESPONSE TEAMS
Navigation Response Teams are Office of Coast Survey field units that perform surveys for emergency responses,
such as following groundings or hurricanes, and for updating NOS nautical charts. An NRT unit typically consists
of a small survey boat capable of being transported by trailer, an office trailer, and a crew of three hydrographers.
NAVIGATIONAL AID
An instrument, device, chart, method, etc., intended to assist in the navigation of a craft. This expression should
not be confused with the term “Aids to Navigation”, which refers only to devices external to a craft.
NEAT LINE
A line, usually a grid or a graticule, bounding the detail of a map. Also referred to as inner neat line, to differentiate
it from a border drawn outside of a neat line.

NECK
The narrow strip of land with water on each side and connecting two larger bodies of land; an isthmus.
NEW CHART
A chart usually constructed to satisfy the needs of navigation in a particular area, e.g., because the area had no
prior adequate chart coverage of the same scale, or because the limits are radically changed. The new chart may
cancel an existing chart.

NEW EDITION
A chart issue that cancels a previous issue. If the new information renders that existing chart obsolete, the new
printing is designated a new edition. A new edition reflects one or more changes of such importance to navigation
that all previous printings are obsolete. Changes may be based on corrections from the Notice to Mariners (NTM)
in addition to other sources. The date of a new edition is the date of the latest NGA NTM from which the chart has
been corrected. The edition number and date are printed in the lower left corner of the chart.

NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency)
Former name of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which was adopted in November 2003.
NOISE
Extraneous signals detected by a sonar that affect the system’s efficiency to display, and the operator’s efficiency to
interpret, the signals of interest. Noise can originate from many different sources both internal and external to the
sonar system. See Interference.

NOMINAL RANGE
The maximum distance a light may be seen in clear weather (meteorological visibility of 10 Nautical Miles (NM),
without regard to the curvature of the earth, the height of the eye, or the height of the light. Listed for all federal
lighted aids, except range lights and directional lights.

*Page 252*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NON-TIDAL WATERS
Waters not subject to tidal influence. Under Public Law 31, lands beneath such waters of a state which were
navigable when the state entered the Union are granted to the state.

NORTH AMERICAN DATUM (NAD)
A horizontal control datum which is the same as United States Standard Datum. The name was changed to North
American Datum early in 1913 when Canada and Mexico adopted the United States Standard Datum for their
triangulation. This change in name reflected the continental character the datum now assumed.

NORTH AMERICAN DATUM of 1927 (NAD27)
The name to which the North American Datum was changed in 1932 as a result of the unified adjustment of the
triangulation in the western half of the country. The North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) was the horizontal
control datum for the U.S. that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with its
origin at the survey station Meades Ranch, Kansas. The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero.
As of 1963, all of the conterminous United States and the whole of Alaska (including the offshore islands in the
Bering Sea) were connected by one continuous triangulation and placed on NAD27.

NORTH AMERICAN DATUM of 1983 (NAD83)
The modern horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America which is based
on a geocentric (earth centered) origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980. NAD 83 is based on the adjustment
of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin. The
computation of the NAD 83 removed significant local distortions from the network which had accumulated
over the years, using the original observations, and makes NAD 83 much more compatible with modern survey
techniques.

NOTICE TO MARINERS (NTM)
A weekly publication of the NGA, which corrects NGA and National Ocean Service (NOS) charts using information
collected from many sources including the U. S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners. The publication contains
only those chart corrections of interest to ocean going vessels. NRT See Navigation Response Teams.
NUMERICAL SCALE
The scale of a survey (or chart) expressed in terms of the distance on the earth represented by one unit on the
survey, e.g., “1 inch equals 20 miles,” “3 inches to the mile.”

*Page 253*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBSOLETE CHART
A chart which is not considered safe to use for navigation because it does not contain the latest important
navigational information.

or aircraft. The term is usually used to refer to an isolated danger to navigation, such as a submerged rock or
pinnacle in the case of marine navigation.

OBSTRUCTION BUOY

of darkness are usually of equal duration.

OCEANOGRAPHY
The study of the ocean, embracing and integrating all knowledge pertaining to the ocean’s physical boundaries, the
chemistry and physics of sea water, marine biology and submarine geology.

OCEAN SURVEY SHEETS (OSS)
Antiquated term that refers to survey sheets that cover large areas of the ocean. Limits of the OSS series were
designed to conform closely to the U.S. Navy Bathymetric series.

OFFSHORE
In NOAA operational hydrographic terms, the zone extending seaward from depths of 8 m. In general terms,
the comparatively flat zone of variable width which extends from the outer margin of the rather steeply sloping
shoreface to the edge of the continental shelf.

OFFSHORE WIND
A wind blowing from the land toward the sea.

OFF STATION
Used to describe a floating navigational aid that is not “on station” or in its assigned geographic location.
OLD HAWAIIAN DATUM
The standard horizontal datum for the main Hawaiian islands. Old Hawaiian Datum is an independent datum that
was derived from the North American Datum 1927 (NAD27).

ON STATION
Used to describe a floating navigational aid that is in its assigned geographic location. Opposite of Off Station.
ONSHORE WIND
A wind blowing from the sea toward the land.

*Page 254*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OOZE
A fine-grained pelagic sediment containing more than 30% organic material combined with amorphous claysized
material and found only in the greater ocean (abyssal) depths off the Continental Shelf on the abyssal plains. Ooze
is a classification by composition, not grain size. Accordingly, considering grain size, ooze is mud but mud is not
necessarily ooze. Soft mud is, commonly, improperly referred to as ooze.

OPEN COAST
The coast that fringes the marginal sea, as distinguished from the coast that fringes inland waters. ORIGIN In
surveying, the reference position from which angles or distances are reckoned. In cartography, (1) the point of
intersection of the coordinate axes, from which the coordinates are reckoned; (2) the origin of coordinates is the
point to which the coordinate values (0, 0) are assigned, irrespective of its position with reference to the axes;
(3) the origin of coordinates is the point from which the computation of the elements of the coordinate system
(projection) proceeds.

ORTHOMETRIC HEIGHT
The distance of a point above the geoid.

ORTHOGONAL
Pertaining to or composed of right angles.

ORTHOPHOTOGRAPH
A photographic copy, prepared from a perspective photograph, in which the displacements of images due to tilt
and relief have been removed.

ORTHOPHOTOMAP
A map made by assembling a number of orthophotographs into a single, composite picture. A grid is usually
added. It may be further improved, cartographically, by photographically bringing edges out sharply in the picture,
or by adding color or symbols.

ORTHOPHOTOQUAD
An orthophotograph, or mosaic of orthophotographs, at the size of a standard U.S.G.S quadrangle (a scale of
1:24,000) with little or no cartographic work added to it.

OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF
All submerged lands lying seaward and outside of the area of “lands beneath navigable waters,” as defined in
section 2(a) of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(a), and of which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the
U.S. and are subject to its jurisdiction and control.

OUTER EDGE OF MARSH
The line delineated on topographic surveys as the dividing line between land and water, rather than the high-water
line, for use on nautical/navigational charts.

OUTFALL
A structure extending into a body of water for the purpose of discharging sewage, storm runoff or cooling water.
OUT-OF-RANGE
Target echoes displayed by the sonar resulting from hard reflectors that are beyond the system range setting.
When an imaging sonar transmits an acoustic pulse, it propagates into the environment. After the pulse travels
beyond the set range of the system, another pulse is transmitted. However, the first pulse is still moving away from
the transducer and sending back echoes. Even though those echoes are returning from out-of-range, this is not
normally a problem because the sonar system gains are reduced in the near field (for the second outgoing pulse).

*Page 255*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a quiet environment, where there is little backscatter in the near field and there are hard targets out of range,
these targets will be imaged after the second pulse starts its propagation. In radar, this phenomenon is called a
“second sweep return.”
OUTSIDE SOURCE DATA (OSD)
Previously called Third Party Data. Source data that originates from sources other than the Office of Coast Survey
(OCS) hydrographic field units and contractors. Outside sources would include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, USGS, state and local governments, academic institutions and commercial
entities not conducting surveys under contract to NOAA/OCS.

OVERFALLS
Short, breaking waves occurring when a strong current passes over a shoal or other submarine obstruction or
meets a contrary current or wind.

OVERLAP
The area of seabed between survey lines that is ensonified twice, once by the swath on each side. Planned overlap
is useful to assure efficient 100% coverage of the seabed. Since a vessel’s track line is not a perfectly straight line,
overlap of one swath with a portion of the next will help ensure that there are no data gaps between tracks.
OVERLAY
1. A printing or drawing on a transparent or semitransparent medium at the same scale as a map, chart, etc., to
show details not appearing, or requiring special emphasis, on the original. 2. Additional data, or a pattern, printed
after the other features so as to “overlay” them. 3. A sheet containing explanatory or modifying data, placed over
and keyed to the existing or basic copy. Sometimes used as a means of correcting the underlying copy.
OVERPRINT
Information printed or stamped upon a map or chart, in addition to that originally printed, to show data of
importance or special use.

OVER-THE-GROUND
A measurement of the speed or course of a vessel with respect to the seabed, independent of movement in relation
to wind or water.

equal latitude.

PARITY BIT
A data bit, set at “0” or “1,” that provides information on whether the total number of bits in a data field is even or
odd. This is used to ensure data integrity and that no data is lost. PASS A single procession by a seabed anomaly
during a sonar survey. Multiple passes by a target may be necessary for target classification and interpretation. For

*Page 256*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

example, thermal discontinuities rarely look the same on any two passes. A target that may be a school of fish can
be properly identified by multiple passes because fish schools rarely stay in one place over any length of time.
PASSAGE
A narrow navigable channel, especially one through reefs or islands. Sometimes called a pass or, in New England
waters, a hole.

PASSING LIGHT
A term applied to a lower candlepower light mounted on a light structure. Used where a mariner passes out of the
main light beam (such as a range light) but still needs to keep the structure in sight during transit.
PASSIVE SONAR
A sonar system having only a hydrophone, and capable of receiving signals but not transmitting them.
PATH-TRACKING
The ability of a towed body to accurately follow the path along which it is towed. In the absence of high velocity
currents and using short cables, most side scan sonar towfish will track along the ship’s path well. However, if the
sonar is towed at 90 degrees to a strong current and over long cable, it will tend to be displaced from the vessel’s
path and heading. See Lateral Offset.

P-CODE
A term related to GPS signals. A bi-phase shift modulated on both the L1 and L2 carrier frequencies. P-code has a
10.23 MHz bit rate and, as implemented in GPS, has a period of 1 week. Each satellite has a unique P-code that is
used to distinguish that satellite from all others.

PEBBLES
Beach material, usually well-rounded and between 4 - 64 mm in diameter.

PECKED LINE
A cartographic term describing a symbol consisting of a line broken at regular intervals.

PERCH
A staff placed on top of a buoy, rock, or shoal as a mark for navigators. A ball or cage is sometimes placed at the
top of the perch as an identifying mark.

PENINSULA
A body of land jutting into and nearly surrounded by water, frequently (but not necessarily) connected to a larger
body of land by a neck or isthmus.

PERIOD
The interval of time necessary for a regularly recurring motion to make a complete cycle. The period of a navigational
light is the time taken to exhibit one complete sequence of intervals of light and darkness.

PHASE
Relative measurement describing the temporal relationship between two waves with the same frequency. Phase
is measured in degrees, and one full oscillation cycle has 360 degrees. One way to think of phase is this: If two
pendulums are swinging at the same frequency and are in the same position at the same instant, then they are in
phase with each other.

PHOTOGRAMMETRIC COMPILATION
The production of a map or chart, or portion thereof, from aerial photographs and geodetic control data. When
compilation involves stereo instruments, this is called stereocompilation.

PHOTOGRAMMETRIC SURVEY
A survey of a portion of the land surface utilizing aerial photographs and reduced to map form by stereoscopic or
other instrumental equipment.

PHOTOGRAMMETRY
1. The science of obtaining reliable measurements from photographic images. 2. The science of preparing charts
and maps from aerial photographs using stereoscopic equipment and methods.

PHOTOMOSAIC
1. An assemblage of photographs, each of which shows part of a region, put together in such a way that each point
in the region appears once and only once in the assemblage, with scale variation minimized. A photomosaic is
assembled by trimming, warping, and fitting together the individual photographs. If the photographs were taken
at different heights, the individual photographs must be enlarged or reduced to a common scale. 2. An assemblage
of parts of aerial photographs joined together to leave as few variations of scale as possible.

PHOTOTRIANGULATION
The determination of horizontal or vertical coordinates from measurements of angle, distance, or coordinates
of points on overlapping photographs. Phototriangulation is classified as terrestrial or aerial, depending on
whether the photographs were taken on the ground or from the air. Aerial phototriangulation is commonly called
“aerotriangulation.”

and are often used as privately maintained aids to navigation.

PITCH
An instability in vessel or towfish attitude expressed by the alternate rise and fall of the bow/nose and stern/tail
about a horizontal axis.

PLANE RECTANGULAR COORDINATES
A system of coordinates in a horizontal plane, used to describe the positions of points with respect to an arbitrary
origin. The origin is established by a pair of axes which intersect at right angles. The position of a point is determined
by the perpendicular distances to these axes. Also call plane coordinates.

PLANETABLE
A surveying instrument used in topographic mapping by which the surveyor plots his survey in the field directly
from the observations, without the necessity of keeping notes for later office plotting. It consists essentially of a
drawing board on a tripod to which the survey sheet is clamped and adjusted in the horizontal plane, an alidade (a
telescope mounted on a metal, straight-edge ruler) for measuring directions and distances to salient features of the
terrain, and a telemeter rod graduated for the optical measurement of distances from the observer.
PLANIMETER
A mechanical integrator for measuring the area of a plane surface.

PLANIMETRIC SURVEY
A survey which presents the horizontal position only for the features represented; distinguished from a topographic
map by the omission of relief.

PLAT
A diagram drawn to scale showing land boundaries and subdivisions, together with all data essential to the
description and identification of the several units shown thereon, and including one or more certificates indicating
due approval. A plat differs from a map in that it does not necessarily show additional cultural, drainage, and relief
features.

PLATFORM
1. In oceanographic terminology, any man-made structure (aircraft, ship, buoy, or tower) from which or on which
oceanographic instruments are suspended, installed, or operated. 2. Any offshore fixed or floating structure
providing a flat or specially designed working surface above the water which serves a specific and/or specialized
purpose, e.g., drilling, survey, research, potable water intake, swimming-diving, or storage functions.

*Page 259*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLOT
1. A map, chart, or graph representing data of any sort. 2. To represent on a diagram or chart the position or course
of a target in terms of angles and distances from known position; to locate a position on a map or a chart. 3. A
portion of a map or overlay on which are drawn the outlines of the areas covered by one or more photographs. 4.
To generate graphic images according to a given system of coordinate values, such as scale factor. 5. To use a plotter.
PLOTTING SHEET
(Used prior to digital plotters) A blank chart, usually on the Mercator projection, showing only the graticule and a
compass rose, so that the plotting sheet can be used for any longitude. In hydrographic surveying, a working sheet
on which the main stations of the survey are plotted. It formed the framework of the survey and provided the basis
for accurately locating and plotting all the detail of the survey.

POINT
1. The extreme end of a cape, or the outer end of any land area protruding into the water (less prominent than a
cape). 2. A place having position, but no extent. 3. One thirty-second of a circle, or 11 ¼ °. A cardinal point is any
of the 4 principal directions, north, east, south, or west; an intercardinal point is any of the 4 directions midway
between the cardinal points, northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest. Also called compass points when used
in reference to compass directions.

POINT FEATURE
A point feature is a single point item such as a pile, wreck, rock, obstruction, etc. located at one specific geographic
location. This may include detached positions for data types such as bottom samples, sound velocity cast locations,
navigational aids, feature disprovals, existing navigationally significant features, and AWOIS items.
POINT SYMBOL
A symbol employed to indicate that a particular phenomenon occurs at, or a particular value may be attributed to,
a specific point on a map.

POLAR COORDINATES
1. A coordinate system based on a sphere. 2. An alternative system of marking a point on a plane by its radial
distance (r) from an “origin” and a polar angle (f). When 3-dimensional polar coordinates overlap a Cartesian (x,
y, z) system, q is the angle between the line to the origin and the z-axis, while f is the (counter-clockwise) angle
between the projection of that line onto the (x,y) plane and the x-axis. Concerning(q, f), see also latitude and
longitude, declination, azimuth and elevations. 3. An alternative to the usual Cartesian method of addressing
image pixels. Polar coordinates use the coordinate pair, angle and radius from an origin instead of column and
row. 4. A 2-D coordinate system used to locate a point in a plane by specifying a distance and an angle from the
coordinate origin. If another distance normal to the coordinate origin is added, cylindrical coordinates can be
specified.

POLE
An elongated rod of wood or metal driven into the bottom to serve a particular purpose. Of smaller diameter than
a pile, but larger diameter than a stake.

POLYCONIC PROJECTION
A map projection having the central geographic meridian represented by a straight line, along which the spacing
for lines representing the geographic parallels is proportional to the distances between the parallels; the parallels
are represented by arches of circles that are not concentric, but whose centers lie on the line representing the
central meridian, and whose radii are determined by the lengths of the elements of cones which are tangent along
the parallels. All meridians except the central ones are curved. The projection is neither conformal nor equal area,
but it has been widely used for maps of small areas because of the ease with which it can be constructed. The origin

*Page 260*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the projection, at least in concept, is credited to Ferdinand R. Hassler, the first Superintendent of the Coast
Survey, and was used for all the hydrographic surveys of the agency until the 1990s.

PONTOON BRIDGE
A bridge supported on pontoons.

PORT
A place for the loading and unloading of vessels recognized and supervised for maritime purposes by the public
authorities. The term includes a city or borough for the reception of mariners and merchants, and therefore
denotes something more than a harbor. A port may possess a harbor but a harbor is not necessarily a port. Any
natural creek or inlet on the sea shore with adequate depth of water and sufficient shelter for ships fulfills the
essential conditions of a harbor. To make it a port, in the accepted sense of the word, there must be additional
accommodations and facilities for landing passengers and goods.

PORT SERIES
A series of reports, published jointly by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Maritime Administration
(MARAD), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The reports describe in detail pilotage information
for the principal ports of the United States, as well as the facilities and services available to shipping at selected U.S.
seaports.

POSITION
Data which define the location of a point with respect to a reference system. The coordinates that define a location.
The place occupied by a point on the surface of the Earth, or in space.

POSITION APPROXIMATE
Of inexact position. The expression is used principally on charts to indicate that the position of a wreck, shoal, etc.,
has not been accurately determined or does not remain fixed. Usually shown by the abbreviation “PA.”
POSITION DOUBTFUL
Of uncertain position. The expression is used principally on charts to indicate that a wreck, shoal, etc., has been
reported in various positions and not definitely determined in any. Usually shown by the abbreviation “PD.”
POSITION NUMBERS
Numbers historically assigned to a “fix” of the survey boat’s position at one particular time, starting with number
1 at the beginning of the survey and continuing consecutively to the end of the survey.

POSITION REPORTED
The reported location of a feature. Usually, this refers to the geographic location of a feature that has been reported
to proper authorities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard or local marine agencies. Usually shown on charts by the text
“reported.”
POST
A small beacon used for marking channels. This beacon is usually more substantial than a perch, and has a diameter
larger than that of a stake but smaller than that of a pile.

POST-PROCESSING
Data processing performed after real-time data acquisition.

*Page 261*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POTABLE WATER INTAKE (PWI)
A structure designed for the intake of drinking water. The intake is usually elevated above the bottom, and supported
and protected by a debris-screening structure (crib), usually a separately charted feature.

POUND NET
A set net composed of vertical netting supported and held in place by stakes. It consists of three essential parts, the
pot (pound, pocket, bowl), the wings or hearts, and the leader or lead. The pound consists of a bag of stout netting
with 1-in meshes the margin of which is supported by upright stakes. The bottom of the pound is spread and
secured by ropes which pass through loops near the lower end of the stakes. The wings or heart are vertical fences
of netting diverging from the entrance of the net. The mesh is ½ -in and is supported by stakes. The leader, which
may vary in length from about 150 - 1,000 ft or more, extends from shore or shallow water into deeper water, and
deflects the fish towards the heart or wings.

PRECAUTIONARY AREA
A routing measure comprising an area within defined limits where ships must navigate with particular caution and
within which the direction of traffic flow may be recommended.

PRECISION
The degree of refinement of a value; not to be confused with its accuracy, which is the degree of conformance with
the correct value.

PREDICTED TIDES
Tide levels that are predicted by combining the harmonic constituents over time at a particular tidal location.
PRELIMINARY CHART
A chart for which there is a requirement, but for an area in which some or all of the survey data does not meet
modern standards. The deficiencies in such surveys may be due to small scale, out-moded, or non-standard survey
techniques, outdated, unprocessed, or unapproved data, or other factors causing the survey data to fall below
customary standards for the scale of the chart. A preliminary chart may or may not be published in full color.
Included on the chart shall be a source diagram and a warning note stating that (all or much of) the hydrography
shown on the chart is not of customary quality. The chart will retain the “Preliminary” label until it has been
recompiled using contemporary, processed, and approved source material, and all standard chart colors shown.
PRELIMINARY SURVEY
As used in historical NOAA terminology, this was a survey that was of higher order than a reconnaissance, but did
not have the detail of a complete survey.

PRIMARY GAUGE (Primary Control Water Level station)
A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum of 19 years. Its purpose
is to provide data for computing accepted values of the harmonic and nonharmonic constants essential to tide
predictions and to the determination of tidal datums for charting an for coastal and marine boundaries. The data
series from these stations serves as a primary control for the reduction of relatively short series from subordinate
tide stations through the method of comparison of simultaneous observations and for monitoring long-period sea
level trends and variations.

PRIME MERIDIAN
The meridian of longitude 0°, used as the origin for measurement of longitude. The meridian of Greenwich,
England, is almost universally used for this purpose.

*Page 262*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN
A true north-south line (a meridian), extending both north and south of the initial point in the rectangular system
of surveys. Together with the base line, principal meridians constitute the axes of a system and the initial point of
origin of that system.

PRIVATE AIDS TO NAVIGATION
In U.S. waters, those aids to navigation not established and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. Private aids
include those established by other federal agencies with prior U.S. Coast Guard approval, those aids to navigation
on marine structures or other works which the owners are legally obligated to establish, maintain, and operate as
prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard, and those aids which are merely desired, for one reason or another, by the
individual corporation, state or local government, or other body that has established the aid with U.S. Coast Guard
approval. Although private aids to navigation are inspected periodically by the U.S. Coast Guard, the mariner
should exercise special caution when using them for general navigation.

PROBABLE ERROR
An error (or deviation from the mean) of such magnitude that the likelihood of its being exceeded in a set of
observations is equal to the likelihood of its not being exceeded (50% probability); its value is that of the standard
error multiplied by 0.6745. The use of standard error is sometimes preferred {to probable error} in statistical
studies.

PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
A document issued by NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey containing the unique requirements for a hydrographic
survey project. It pertains only to those projects to be conducted by NOAA survey platforms and hydrographers
and is not intended to be used by others working under contract. This term supersedes the term Letter Instructions.
PROJECT/VESSEL/DAY/LINE (PVDL)
Hierarchical format used to store CARIS hydrographic data.

PROJECTION
The representation of a figure on a surface, either plane or curved, according to a definite plan. In a perspective
projection this is done by means of projecting lines emanating from a single point, which may be infinity. In
cartography, any systematic arrangement of meridians and parallels portraying the curved surface of the sphere or
spheroid upon a plane. Also called map projection or chart projection.

PROJECTOR
A sonar transducer that translates electrical signals into pressure waves (sound signals), and transmits them
through the water.

PROLATE SPHEROID
An ellipsoid of revolution, the major axis of which is the axis of revolution.

PROOF
In cartography, an advanced copy of a map produced to check the design, register and/or to enable errors to be
detected and corrected before final printing.

PROOF CHECKING
The examination of the proof and comparison with its sources to point out any errors, omissions, and necessary
improvements.

*Page 263*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPORTIONAL DIVIDERS
An instrument consisting in its simple form of two legs pointed at both ends and provided with an adjustable
pivot, so that for any given pivot setting, the distance between one set of pointed ends always bears the same ratio
to the distance between the other set. A change in the pivot changes the ratio. The dividers are used in transferring
measurements between different charts or drawings that are not at the same scale.

PROVISIONAL CHARTS
A special chart for which there is an urgent need. The chart is compiled from processed and approved source
material and may be smooth drafted for direct reproduction. All charted information is combined on the black
plate and no colors are shown. The chart will retain the “provisional” label until all smooth drafted detail is engraved
and standard chart colors are added.

PUBLICATION NO. 9
American Practical Navigator; a publication of the NGA, originally by Nathaniel Bowditch, comprising an epitome
of navigation and navigational astronomy and providing tables for solution of navigational problems. Popularly
called Bowditch.

PUBLIC LAW 31 (SUBMERGED LANDS ACT)
An act passed during the 1st session of the 83rd Congress and signed into law on May 22, 1953. Confirms and
establishes the titles of the states to lands beneath navigable water within their boundaries and to the natural
resources within such lands and water. The act also established jurisdiction and control of the United States over
the natural resources of the seabed of the continental shelf seaward of state boundaries.

PUBLIC LAW 212 (OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS ACT)
An act passed during the 1st session of the 83rd Congress and signed into law on August 7, 1953. Provides for
the jurisdiction, control, and administration by the United States over the submerged lands seaward of the states’
boundaries as defined in Public Law 31, that is, over the outer continental shelf.

PUBLISHER’S NOTE
A marginal note which indicates the publisher and usually the place of publication.

PULSE
A short burst of sonar, typically measured as a function of time, distance, or power. Each pulse of sonar is also
known as a ping.

PULSE LENGTH
The length of time that an active sonar is transmitting one pulse, typically expressed in milliseconds. Longer pulse
lengths allow more power to be put into the water at the expense of across track resolution. This has the effect of
gaining range for large area surveying.

PULSE WIDTH
The distance of the ensonified water, in the range dimension, at a given point in time, expressed in meters and
determined by multiplying the pulse length by the speed of sound through the water. Pulse widths are measured
to determine the maximum theoretical resolution of an imaging sonar.

PUMPING PLATFORM COMPLEX (PPC)
A single platform or a series of inter-connected platforms that have one or more of the following capabilities:
(1) Pumping oil between a vessel and the shore; (2) berthing and messing facilities for assigned personnel; (3) a
landing area for helicopters; (4) mooring and loading for small vessels.

7.17 Q
--------

QUAD
A commonly used slang expression for “quadrangle.” The term used to refer to a topographic map published
by the U. S. Geological Survey.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
A continuing evaluation of the quality control process. It is not a double check on each product, but rather a “check
on the checkers.” Quality assurance techniques often employ a statistical sampling method to examine just enough
of the products to determine that the quality control system is effective. Quality assurance is not intended to catch
all the deficiencies, but only to determine if the rates of deficiencies that pass through the quality control system
are within the acceptable limits established by management. Any problem identified by the quality assurance
process should result in corrective action in the quality control process. Since quality assurance evaluates part of
the production system, i.e., quality control, it must be organizationally separately from the production manager in
order to ensure objectivity.

QUALITY CONTROL
A routine inspection to insure that the product conforms with certain minimum standards and specifications that
have been established by management. Quality control is usually performed at the work site by supervisors or by
designated inspectors. Products that fail to meet the minimum standards are reprocessed or destroyed.
QUALITY CONTROL REPORT
Historically, a report comprising a critique of the quality and adequacy of the field data acquisition and processing
of a given survey. Significant errors, conflicts, or discrepancies which cannot be expeditiously corrected in the
records or on the smooth sheet were discussed, and appropriate recommendations regarding corrective action
were included in the report. During the period from October 1975 through September 1982, all hydrographic
surveys were subjected to a quality control inspection.

QUAY
A structure approximately parallel to the shoreline and accommodating ships on one side only, the other side
being attached to the shore. It is usually of solid construction, as contrasted with the open pile construction usually
used for piers. A similar facility of more open construction is called a wharf.

QUENCH
The loss of a sonar signal, most often due to water-borne discontinuities and resulting in blank sonar display areas.
Quenching will affect both the outgoing sonar pulse and the returning echoes.

QUENCHING
The great reduction in underwater sound transmission or reception resulting from absorption and scattering of
sound energy by air bubbles entrapped around the sonar dome.

7.18 R
-------

RACE
Swiftly flowing water in a narrow channel or river; also the channel itself, which may be artificial, as in a mill-race.
Also, a swift rush of water through a narrow channel in tidal waters, caused by the tidal movement of the waters.
RADIO ACOUSTIC RANGING (RAR)
A method of position determination in offshore hydrographic surveying which utilized underwater sound

*Page 265*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

transmission and radio to determine the distance of the survey vessel from two or more known stations. This
method was discontinued during World War II and has since been superseded by electronic methods.

RADIO BEACON
Electronic apparatus which transmits a radio signal to provide a line of position for marine navigation.
RAMP
A sloping structure that can be used, either as a landing or launching place, at variable water levels, for small
vessels, landing ships, or amphibious airplanes, or for hauling a cradle carrying a vessel.

RANDOM ERROR
An error whose occurrence depends on the laws of chance only. Random errors are typically very small with a
mean value of zero.

RANGE
1. In hydrographic positioning, the distance between the vessel or observer and a remote control station or range
measuring instrument. 2. In navigation, two or more objects in a line. Such objects are said to be in a range. An
observer having them in range is said to be on the range. Two beacons are frequently located for the specific
purpose of forming a range to indicate a safe route or the centerline of a channel. 3. When referring to side scan
sonar, a sonar setting which represents a distance, usually measured in meters, that is the maximum distance from
the towfish that the sonar will display (the range setting on the sonar also determines the time between outgoing
sonar pulses); also synonymous with the across-track dimension. Once the range setting on the system is set, when
returning echoes arrive from that distance away from the transducer, the ping cycle starts again and a new acoustic
pulse is transmitted in to the water.

RANGE-AZIMUTH
A method of determining a geographic position using both (a) the range or distance from a control point to a
survey vessel, and (b) the azimuth or direction as observed from the same control point to that vessel.
RANGE OF TIDE
The difference in height between consecutive high and low waters. The mean range is the difference in height
between mean high water and mean low water.

RANGE RESOLUTION
The ability of the sonar to image, separately and distinctly, objects perpendicular to the towfish heading. The range
resolution is determined, in part, by the pulse length of the sonar. A short pulse length will display two targets
close together as separate and distinct anomalies. The same two targets, when ensonified by a longer pulse length
can be simultaneously enveloped by the pulse. This results in the two objects appearing as one in the sonar display.
RASTER
A matrix of row and column data points whose values represent energy being reflected or emitted from the object
being viewed. These values, or pixels, can be viewed on a display monitor as a black and white or a color
image. Raster images are made up of individual dots, each of which has a defined value that precisely identifies its
specific color, size, and place within the image. Unlike a vectorized raster, which contains attributed information,
a raster image does not contain any feature information. Also known as a bitmapped image.

RAY BENDING
See Refraction

*Page 266*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REACH
The comparatively straight segment of a river or channel between two bends. That part of a winding river between
the last bend and the sea is called a sea reach; that part between the harbor and the first bend is called the harbor
reach.

REAL TIME KINEMATIC (RTK)
A DGPS process where GPS carrier-phase (which delivers the most accurate GPS information) corrections are
transmitted in real-time from a reference receiver at a known location to one or more remote rover receivers.
RECIPROCAL BEARING
A bearing differing by 180°, or one measured in the opposite direction, from a given bearing.

RECOGNITION
The acknowledgment by the sonar operator of the existence of a target or anomaly as displayed in the sonar data.
Lack of anomaly recognition can be problematic particularly during side scan sonar operations. Catastrophic
towfish altitude loss, severe fish instability, and search targets all should be recognized by the operator any time
they occur. Recognition is distinguished from detection as being operator-dependent. See Detectability.
RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY
A hasty preliminary survey of a region made to provide some advance information regarding the area which may
be useful to the mariner, pending the execution of more complete surveys.

RECONSTRUCTED CHART
This term is used when the accumulation of new charting information is sufficiently extensive enough to affect
most of an existing chart. This may also occur if there are changes to the chart limits or if the chart is to be
recompiled on a new projection using computer-supported compilation and scribing techniques.

RECOVERY OF STATION
In surveying, the identifying and checking of an original station. This is considered as recovered when its mark
(monument) is identified as authentic and proved to be occupying its original site.

RECREATIONAL CHARTS
These agency charts are a series of large-scale charts providing sequential page coverage for selected Great Lakes
areas. These charts are published in book format with each page being a large-scale, small-sized chart.
RECTANGULAR COORDINATES
Magnitudes defining a point relative to two perpendicular lines called axes. The magnitudes indicate the
perpendicular distance from each axis. The vertical distance is called the ordinate and the horizontal distance the
abscissa. This is a form of Cartesian coordinates.

REDUCTION OF SOUNDINGS
The correction of observed depths for instrument errors, systematic bias, sound velocity variation, draft and water
level above datum.

REEF
A rocky or coral elevation which may be dangerous to surface navigation, sometimes uncovering at the sounding
datum. A rocky reef is always detached from shore; a coral reef may or may not be connected with the shore.
REFERENCE LINE
Any line which can serve as a reference or base for the measurement of other quantities. Also called a datum line.

*Page 267*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REFERENCE MARK
In surveying, a supplementary mark of permanent character close to a station or to a base terminal, to which it is
related by an accurately measured distance and direction, and/or a difference in elevation.

REFERENCE POINT
Any point which can serve as a reference or base for the measurement of other quantities. Also called a datum
point.

REFERENCE SPHEROID (OR ELLIPSOID)
A theoretical figure whose dimensions closely approach the dimensions of the geoid. The exact dimensions are
determined by various considerations of the section of the Earth’s surface considered. The Spheroids of Bessel,
Clarke, Delambre, Everest, Hayford, Helmett, and others have been adopted as reference spheroids in geodetic
work by different countries.

REFLECTING PROJECTOR
An instrument by means of which the image of a photograph can be projected onto a map. By varying the position
of the projector lens, the scale of the projected image can be varied.

REFRACTION
The change of direction of a sound beam when passing obliquely from one medium into another, where its wave
velocity is different. Refraction is a type of ray bending that will affect acoustic returns for proper sonar imaging.
This occurs when sonar pulses encounter thermal and haline discontinuities. In a normal summer thermocline
environment, a side scan beam can be refracted sharply to the seafloor, severely limiting range.

REGISTER MARKS
Designated marks, such as small crosses, circles, or other patterns applied to original copy prior to reproduction
to facilitate registration of plates and to indicate the relative positions of successive impressions. Also called corner
marks, corner ticks, register ticks, registration ticks, or ticks.

REGISTRATION
Correct positioning of one component of a composite map image in relation to the other components. Map
registration (also called geo-referencing) is the process of converting file or page coordinates to map coordinates.
For example, a scanned map can have an origin point and a raster association where each point on the map is
identifiable by its file coordinates, whether by numerals or by pixels. The task is to then convert these numeral
coordinates to map coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude: x, y).

REGISTRY NUMBER
A number assigned to topographic and hydrographic surveys within NOAA for identification and filing purposes.
Topographic surveys are identified by a variety of designations, depending on vintage, e.g., “T,” “TP,” “DM,” and
“GC.” Hydrographic surveys are similarly identified with designations such as “H,” “FE,” “S,” and “D.” Registry
numbers beginning with the letter “W” are used to identify surveys originating with sources other than those
under the direct administrative control of NOAA.

REMOTE HEAVE
The apparent vertical motion of a sensor due to vessel roll and/or pitch acting on a lever arm between the sensor
and the vessel’s center of motion.

REPEATABILITY
A measure of the variability of a series of measurements of the same quantity/position/depth. High repeatability
is indicative of high precision.

*Page 268*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPRESENTATIVE FRACTION (RF)
The scale of a map or chart expressed as a fraction or ratio that relates unit distance on the map to distance
measured in the same unit on the ground. Also called natural scale, fractional scale.

REPRINT
A reprinting of a chart without revision, necessitated by the depletion of stock. The issue is an exact duplicate of
the current issue with no changes in printing or publication dates.

RESIDUAL ERROR
The difference between any value of a quantity in a series of observations, corrected for known systematic errors,
and the value of the quantity obtained from the adjustment of that series. Sometimes called residual.
RESTRICTED AREA
A specified area designated by appropriate authority and shown on charts within which navigation is restricted in
accordance with certain specified conditions.

RESTRICTED WATERS
Areas which for navigational reasons, such as the presence of shoals or other dangers, confine the movements of
shipping within narrow limits.

RETRACTABALE BRIDGE
A bridge with a movable span that can be withdrawn horizontally or within the remaining structure of the bridge.
REVERBERATION
The echoing of a sonar signal from a target or targets. Echo and reverberation are often used interchangeably,
although targets are more often described as returning an echo whereas large ensonified areas such as the seafloor
are described as reverberating under the influence of sonar.

REVETMENT
A retaining wall or facing constructed of riprap or concrete, etc., built to protect an embankment or shore structure
against erosion by wave action or currents.

REVIEW
The final step in the processing of the field data or a hydrographic survey. Its purpose was to consider the survey in
its broader aspects, to correlate it with all prior surveys of the agency covering the same area, with historical data
that may have been received from other sources, and to lay the foundation for future surveys in the area because of
indicated changes, inadequate development, or conflicting information. In 1982, this step was effectively merged
into a process called Evaluation, the results of which are documented in an Evaluation Report.

See also Review Report, Verifier’s Report.

REVIEW REPORT
A report, formerly prepared in agency headquarters, which summarizes pertinent facts relating to a given
hydrographic survey. Included in the report are sections which address the quality of the hydrographic survey
and detailed comparisons made with prior hydrographic surveys and the appropriate nautical charts. Included
in the report are specific evaluations and recommendations regarding the adequacy of the survey to supersede
prior survey data and charted information. The formal review function was transferred to the Office of Marine
Operations in October, 1975, and the former “Review Report” was renamed the “Verifier’s Report.” See Review,
Evaluation Report, and Verifier’s Report.

*Page 269*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVISED PRINT
A chart issue that does not cancel a current edition; the revisions are minor and the edition number remains the
same, but the print date is changed, and the chart is designated a revised print of that chart. The date of a revised
print is shown to the right of the edition date.

RHUMB DISTANCE
The length of the tack a ship makes when sailing from one place to another without changing course.
RHUMB LINE
A line on the surface of the earth making the same oblique angle with all meridians; a loxodrome or loxodromic
curve spiraling toward the poles in a constant true direction. Parallels and meridian, which also maintain constant
true directions, may be considered special cases of the rhumb line. A rhumb line is a straight line on a mercator
projection.

RIFFLE
A shoal, reef, or shallow in a stream, producing a stretch of ruffled or choppy water.

RIGHT BANK
The river bank on the right-hand side as one proceeds downstream.

RINGING
In a transducer, this is the reception of the transducer output pulse at the time of transmission. In active sonar
systems, the projector and the hydrophone are one and the same, so the hydrophone receives its own outgoing
pulse. In a target, this is a well-documented phenomenon resulting from multiple echoes from certain types of
targets due to the acoustical physics of sound pulse wrap-around and reflections internal to the target.
RIPARIAN BOUNDARIES
Water boundaries, or boundaries formed by the sea or a river. The general rule is that riparian boundaries shift
with changes due to accretion or erosion but retain their original location. Such changes may be due to rapid
erosion of the shoreland by waves during a storm, sudden cutting off of land by flood, currents, or change in course
of a body of water, or by artificial causes.

RIP-RAP
A layer, facing, or protective mound of stones or similar durable material, emplaced as in a revetment to prevent
erosion, scouring, or sloughing of a structure or embankment.

RISE
A long, broad elevation that rises gently and generally smoothly from the sea floor.

RIVER
A natural stream of water, of greater volume than a creek or rivulet, flowing in a more or less permanent bed
or channel, between defined banks or walls, with a current which may either be continuous in one direction or
affected by the ebb and flow of the tide.

ROAD
An open anchorage affording less protection than a harbor. Some protection may be afforded by reefs, shoals, etc.
Often used in the plural. Also called roadstead.

*Page 270*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ROADSTEAD
An area of the sea used for the anchorage of vessels and transshipment of cargo, usually without the protection
from weather associated with ports and harbors. Roadsteads are part of the territorial sea but are not inland waters.
ROCK
An isolated rocky formation or a single large stone, usually one constituting a danger to navigation. It may be
always submerged, always uncovered, or alternately covered and uncovered by the tide.

ROCK AWASH
In tidal areas, a rock that uncovers, or nearly uncovers, near the vertical datum of reference prescribed for that
area. See Sunken Rock.

ROCKY AREA
An area with a rocky bottom.

ROLL
The rhythmic movement of a ship or towbody about its longitudinal axis.

ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR
See Standard Error.

ROTATION
Turning of a body about an axis within the body, as the daily rotation of the Earth.

ROV
Acronym for Remotely Operated Vehicle (submersible), an unmanned underwater vehicle that is connected to an
operator via a power and/or communication tether. See AUV.

ROUTE CHARTS
Nautical charts produced by the agency and designed for river and narrow waterway coverage, and for much of the
Intracoastal Waterway. They are published in the small-craft pocket fold format.

RUINS
A ruin is a structure in a decayed or deteriorated condition resulting from neglect or disuse, or a damaged structure
in need of repair. A ruin is considered hazardous if it extends over or into navigable waters and thus represents a
danger to surface navigation.

RUB-TEST
The process of manually creating friction on a transducer face in order to test system electrical continuity. Before
a sonar towbody is put in the water, it is a common practice to test the system on deck. Because air is a high
impedance medium for sonar, the best method of testing system function is to rub the transducer face. In a dual
channel side scan sonar, one transducer is rubbed, then the opposite is rubbed to clarify that the transducers are
not wired to the wrong display channels.

SAILING CHARTS
Charts of scales 1:600,000 and smaller for planning and for fixing the mariner’s position as she approaches the coast
from the open ocean, or for sailing between distant coastwise ports. The shoreline and topography are generalized

*Page 271*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and only offshore soundings, principal navigational lights and buoys, and landmarks visible at considerable
distances are shown.

SAILING DIRECTIONS
Publications similar in scope to the Coast Pilots of the agency, published by other hydrographic offices.
SALINITY
A measure of the quantity of dissolved salts in sea water. It is normally defined as the total amount of dissolved
solids in sea water in parts per thousand (0/00) by weight when all the carbonate has been converted to oxide, the
bromide and iodide converted to chloride, and all organic matter is completely oxidized. In practice, salinity is
not determined directly but is computed from chlorinity, electrical conductivity, refractive index, or some other
property whose relationship to salinity is well established.

SAND
An unconsolidated mixture of inorganic soil (which may include disintegrated shells and coral), consisting of
small but easily distinguishable grains ranging in size from about 0.062 mm to 2.0 mm.

SANDING
An irregular dot pattern used on some of the early hydrographic surveys to accentuate the area between the highand low-water lines.
SAND SPIT
A narrow embankment, created by an excess of deposition at its seaward terminus, with its distal end (the end
away from the point of origin) terminating in open water.

SAND WAVES
1. Longshore sand waves are large-scale features that maintain form while migrating along the shore with speeds
on the order of kilometers per year. 2. Large-scale asymmetrical bedforms in sandy river beds having high length
to height ratios and continuous crestlines.

SATELLITE POSITIONING SYSTEM
A positioning system consisting of a radio-receiver, or a receiver and transmitter, at the point whose location is
to be determined, one or more beacons or transponders in orbit about the Earth, and a computing system for
determining and predicting the orbits. The satellites can be considered points of known location. The radio receiver
may measure times of travel of radio pulses, directions to the satellites, or the Doppler shift in the frequency of the
radio waves emitted by the satellites. The most common system used today is the Global Positioning System (GPS).
SCALE
The relation that a measured distance on a survey, map, or chart bears to the corresponding actual distance on the
earth; for example, if 1 inch on the survey or chart corresponds to 1,000 ft (12,000 inches) on the ground, the scale
would be expressed as 1 inch = 1,000 ft. Expressed as a ratio, this would be a scale of 1:12,000.
SCALE BAR
A graduated line on a map, plan, photograph, or mosaic, by means of which actual ground distances may be
determined.

SCALE FACTOR
A multiplier for reducing a distance obtained from a map by computation or scaling to the actual distance on the
datum of the map.

*Page 272*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCALE MARKS
Equidistant, regular marks on a sonar display used to assist in the mensuration of targets above the seafloor, or to
provide information on the range displacement of targets from a side scan sonar towfish path.

SCATTERING
The diffusion of a sonar signal in many directions through refraction, diffraction and reflection, primarily due to
the material properties of the ensonified areas. Scattering is one of the causes of attenuation in sonar, resulting in
signal weakening. See Backscatter.

SEA
1. A large body of salt water, second in rank to an ocean, more or less landlocked, and generally part of, or connected
with, an ocean or a larger sea. 2. State of the surface of the ocean or lake with regard to wave or swell, as a calm sea.
SEABOARD
The region of land bordering the sea. The terms seaboard, coast, and littoral have nearly the same meanings.
Seaboard is a general term used somewhat loosely to indicate a rather extensive region bordering the sea. Coast
is the region of indefinite width that extends from the sea inland to the first major change in terrain features.
Littoral applies more specifically to the various parts of a region bordering the sea, including the coast, foreshore,
backshore, beach, etc.

SEA BUOY
The outermost buoy marking the entrance to a channel or harbor.

SEA CLUTTER
The images created in a sonar display by acoustic returns from a rough sea surface. When using side scan sonar,
some energy is projected above the horizontal from the wide vertical beam. If the sea surface is rough and within
the range setting of the system, formless patches may overlay the normal seabed returns.

SEAFLOOR
The bottom of the ocean when there is a generally smooth gentle gradient. Also referred to as the sea bed or sea
bottom.

SEA GRASS
Members of marine seed plants that grow chiefly on sand or sand-mud bottom. They are most abundant in water
less than 9 m deep. The most common varieties are: eel grass, turtle grass, manatee grass.

SEA MILE
An approximate mean value of the nautical mile equal to 6080 feet, or the length of a minute of arc along the
meridian at latitude 48°.

SEAMOUNT
An isolated or comparatively isolated elevation rising 1000 meters or more from the seafloor and of limited extent
across the summit.

SEA STATE
The numerical or written description of ocean surface roughness. For more precise usage, sea state may be defined
as the average height of the highest one-third of the waves observed in the wave train.

*Page 273*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEAWALL
A structure built along a portion of a coast primarily to prevent erosion and other damage by wave action. It retains
earth against its shoreward face.

SEA WATER
The water of the seas, distinguished from fresh water by its appreciable salinity. The degree of salinity greatly affects
the water’s physical characteristics.

SECCHI DISK
Circular disk used to measure the transparency of the water column.

SECONDARY GAUGE (Secondary Control Water Level Station)
A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum period of 1 year but less
than 19 years. The series is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a primary gauge. This
station provides for a 365-day harmonic analysis including the seasonal fluctuation of sea level.
SECONDARY PHASE FACTOR CORRECTION
A correction for additional time (or phase delay) for transmission of a low-frequency signal over an all-seawater
path when the signal transit time is based on the free-space velocity. The LORAN-C lattices as tabulated in tables
or overprinted on the nautical chart normally include compensation for secondary phase factor.

SEDIMENT
Loose fragments of rocks, minerals, or organic material that are transported from their source for varying distances
and deposited by air, wind, ice, and water. Other sediments are precipitated from the overlying water or form
chemically in place. Sediment includes all the unconsolidated materials on the sea floor.

SELECTIVE AVAILABILITY (SA)
Selective Availability is a process once used by the U.S. Department of Defense to dither the satellite clock and/or
broadcasts erroneous orbital ephemeris data to create a pseudo range error to prevent adversaries from using the
extremely accurate GPS positioning data.

SEMIDIURNAL Having a period or cycle or approximately one-half of a tidal day. The predominant type of tide
throughout the world is semidiurnal, with two high waters and two low waters each tidal day.

SEPARATION ZONE
A zone or line separating traffic proceeding in one direction from traffic proceeding in another direction. A
separation zone may also be used to separate a traffic lane from the adjacent inshore traffic zone.
SET
The direction toward which a current flows.

SETTLEMENT
Vertical displacement of a moving vessel, relative to what its level would be were it motionless. Settlement is due to
the regional depression of the surface of the water in which the ship moves. It is not an increase in displacement.
At low speeds the effect of moving the hull through the water causes a local depression in the water surface around
the hull. The effect of increasing speed on vessels with planing hulls is to cause them to lift out of the water. Not to
be confused with squat which is the change in vessel trim as it moves through the water.

*Page 274*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEXTANT
A double-reflecting instrument used for measuring angles, primarily horizontal angles between two objects when
used in hydrographic surveying. The sextant has an arc of 60 degrees, a sixth of a circle, from which it derives its
name.

SEXTANT FIX (also called a Three-Point Fix)
A position determined by measuring with a sextant 2 adjacent angles between 3 objects whose relative positions
are known.

SHADED RELIEF
A cartographic technique that provides an apparent 3-dimensional configuration of the terrain on maps and charts
by the use of graded shadows that would be cast by high ground if light were shining from the northwest.
SHADOW
A light area on a normal sonar record that is less ensonified than the surrounding region; most often caused by
signal blocking from an acoustically opaque object on or above the seafloor. Shadows in side scan data are an
important aid to accurate record interpretation. Often, an acoustic shadow will divulge more about a reflector than
the actual acoustic returns. Shadows are also used to calculate the height of an object standing proud of the seabed.
The calculation uses an algebraic solution of similar triangles formed by the height of the towfish, the range to the
target and the length of the shadow.

SHALLOW WATER
Water of such depth that surface waves are noticeably affected by bottom topography. Typically, this implies a
water depth equivalent to less than half the wave length. Recent usage extends the definition of shallow water
seaward to those depths deemed significant to surface navigation – 30 to 40 meters.

SHALLOW WATER MULTIBEAM (SWMB)
A multibeam echosounder system designed specifically for shallow water operations.

SHINGLE
Rounded, often flat waterworn rock fragments larger than approximately 16 millimeters.

SHIPPING LANE
A term used to indicate the general flow of merchant shipping between two departure/ terminal areas.
SHOAL
1.(n) A detached area of any material except rock or coral. The depths over such an area are a danger to navigation,
i.e., minimal depths are 11 fm ( 20 m) or less. Shallow areas consisting of coral or rock are referred to as reefs,
rather than as shoals. 2. (verb) To become shallow gradually. 3. (adj.) Shallow.

SHORE
According to riparian law, the land between ordinary high- and low-water marks, where the common law prevails;
the land over which the daily tides ebb and flow. The civil law concept of shore has been interpreted as extending
to the line of mean higher high tide as it intersects land and some man-made features. See Foreshore and Riparian
Boundaries.

SHORELINE
The line of contact between the land and a body of water. On NOAA nautical charts and survey sheets, the shoreline
approximates the mean high-water (MHW) line. In OCS, this term is sometimes considered to be synonymous
with coastline but the use of the term coastline is discouraged.

*Page 275*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SHORELINE MAP
The graphic representation of photogrammetric surveys. The maps contain graphic data relating to the shoreline,
and alongshore natural and man-made features, and may include a narrow zone of such features inland from the
shoreline. The original sources of a shoreline map are aerial photographs, but may also include ground survey data.
Shoreline maps are generated primarily to support hydrographic operations and nautical chart compilation and
maintenance. Also called Shoreline Manuscript.

SHORELINE PLANE OF REFERENCE (SPOR)
The vertical datum accepted as the reference plane for shoreline, typically MHW.

SIDE SCAN SONAR (SSS)
A form of active sonar in which fixed acoustic beams are directed into the water perpendicularly to the direction
of travel to “scan” the bottom and generate a record of the bottom configuration.

SILL
A submarine ridge or rise of relatively shallow depth separating the sea floor of adjoining basins.
SILT
Sediment particles with a grain size between 0.004 mm and 0.062 mm, i.e., coarser than clay but finer than sand.
SINGLE BEAM ECHO SOUNDER (SBES)
An echo sounder that transmits and receives only one sound pulse at a time; contrasted to a multibeam echo
sounder which records multiple soundings over a swath of the seafloor for each transmission. See Vertical Beam
Echo Sounder (VBES)
SKEWED PROJECTION
Any standard projection used in map or chart construction, which does not conform to a general north-south
format with relation to the neat lines of the map or chart. Alternatively called rotated projection.
SLACK WATER
The state of a tidal current when its speed is near zero, especially the moment when a reversing current changes
direction and its speed is zero. The term is also applied to the entire period of low speed near the time of turning
of the current when it is too weak to be of any practical importance in navigation. The relation of the time of slack
water to the tidal phases varies in different localities.

SLANT RANGE
The straight-path time of arrival of a sonar signal along the hypotenuse of a triangle described by the towfish, the
seafloor directly below it, and the seabed point of interest. In side scan sonar, because the imaging source point
(transducer) is not on the seafloor but rather above it, slant range does not represent the true range between
any 2 objects. Below the towfish, the data is compressed. Farther away from the towfish, the data becomes less
compressed, with the least error at the outermost ranges. The near range compression can be corrected for most
modern sonar systems.

SLANT RANGE CORRECTION
A computerized repositioning of sonar data on the display to counteract range data compression. See Slant Range.
SLIP See Dock.

SLIP RING
An electromechanical component, most often used on a winch that allows full electrical continuity of a side scan

*Page 276*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sonar cable during winch drum operation. Poor quality or dirty slip rings will cause noise in sonar data during
drum movement and a bad individual ring can cause a blank sonar channel.

SLOUGH
A small muddy marshland or tidal waterway which usually connects 2 or more bodies of water. See Bayou.
SMALL CRAFT CHARTS
Agency nautical charts at scales from 1:10,000 to 1:80,000 that are designed for easy reference and plotting in limited
spaces. In some areas these charts represent the only chart coverage for all marine users. They portray regular
nautical chart detail and other specific details of special interest to small-craft operators, such as enlargements of
harbors; tide, current, and weather data; rules-of-the-road information; locations of marine facilities; anchorages;
courses; and distances.

SMALL SCALE
A scale involving a relatively large reduction in size. A small-scale chart is one covering a large area. The opposite is
large-scale. In agency usage, a scale of 1:105,000 (1 inch on survey sheet or chart = 105,000 inches on the ground)
or smaller would fall in this classification. See Large-scale survey (chart).

SMOOTH SHEET
The name given to a plotted representation of data acquired during a hydrographic survey. Essentially, it is a
record of the soundings taken during the field survey, but historically it contained other data necessary for a
proper interpretation of the survey, such as depth curves, bottom characteristics, names of geographic features,
and control stations.

SNAG
A tree, tree stump, or tree branch embedded in the bottom of a body of water, thereby constituting a hazard to
navigation or to fishing gear, e.g., nets. A snag may be submerged, awash, or visible at mean high water.
SNIPPET
That portion of the backscatter time series that fall within the footprint of an individual beam from a multibeam
sonar. This results in a geo-referenced high resolution sidescan image.

SONAR GEOMETRY
The spatial relationship between sonar transducers and their environment, including the seafloor, targets, and the
sea surface. Because of acoustic paths in the ocean environment, sonar imagery may be puzzling at times. Accurate
data interpretation sometimes requires an understanding of the sonar geometry. A good example of this is when
sonar signals return to the transducer over several different paths. See Multipath.

SONARGRAM
A hard copy display of sonar data (typically from side scan) generated either in real time or from recorded data.
Also known as sonographs/sonograms, hard copy “records” of side scan sonar data are generated either by a sonar
printer, a specialized graphics printer or, with modern computerized sonar displays, by any drafting printer in
color or black and white. Early sonar printers used a wet paper technology creating dark and light zones on the
paper. Dry paper recorders were developed in the 1970’s followed by thermal paper recorders in the 1990’s. Many
sonar manufacturers and users now depend upon digitally recorded data.

SONOGRAPH
See Sonargram. SOUND 1. (n) A relatively long arm of the sea or ocean forming a channel between an island and
a mainland or connecting two larger bodies, as a sea and the ocean, or two parts of the same body, usually wider
and more extensive than a strait. 2. (v) To measure the depth of the water.

*Page 277*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOUNDING
A measured depth of water; or the act of measuring depth.

SOUNDING LINE
The path followed by a vessel during the acquisition of soundings.

SOUNDING LINE CROSSINGS
The intersection of two systems of sounding lines at which the depths must agree within specified limits. See=
Crosslines.

SOUNDING MACHINE
A historically used instrument for measuring depth of water, consisting essentially of a reel of wire to one end of
which is attached a weight which carries a device for recording the depth. A crank or motor is provided for reeling
the wire.

SOUNDING POLE
A graduated pole for sounding in shallow water.

SOUNDING RECORDS
Historically consisted of bound record books in which all of the data taken during a hydrographic survey
were entered, and became part of the permanent records of the agency. A typical sounding record of a launch
hydrographic survey using an echo sounder and 3-point fix control contained position numbers, times of taking
the soundings, uncorrected soundings, corrections to be applied, reduced soundings, boat’s headings by compass,
position control data, and pertinent remarks. Soundings acquired during a modern survey are routinely filed in
digital form. The modern sounding record contains a variety of information, depending on the particular system
in use.

SOUND VELOCITY
The rate at which acoustic energy moves through a medium. This term is often used incorrectly instead of the
more technically precise term speed of sound. The rate at which sound energy moves through water is a scalar
quantity and has no specified direction. Hence, speed is the more correct term since velocity is a vector and implies
direction. See speed of sound.

SOURCE MATERIAL
Data of any type required for the compilation of NOAA products including, but not limited to, ground control,
aerial and terrestrial photographs, sketches, maps, and charts; topographic, hydrographic, hypsographic, magnetic,
geodetic, oceanographic and meteorological information; and intelligence documents and written reports
pertaining to natural and man-made features of the area to be mapped or charted.

SOUTHEAST ALASKA DATUM
An independent horizontal datum established toward the end of 1901 by joining together 9 different groups of
triangulation to form 1 continuous scheme on one datum. Applied to all triangulation in Alaska between Dixon
Entrance and Mount St. Elias.

SPECULAR REFLECTOR
An object to which incident sonar beams are largely normal to its surface, making it a strong reflector from a variety
of angles. Objects in this category include cylindrical objects such as pipes and pilings, and spherical objects such
as subsurface floats. Specular reflectors may provide very strong sonar returns and will result in hyperbolic shaped
lines in side scan data. The hyperbola is formed when a target is reflective enough to return even the low level
energy in the side lobes of the sonar’s horizontal beam.

*Page 278*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEED
Rate of motion. The terms speed and velocity are often used interchangeably, but speed is a scalar, having magnitude
only, while velocity is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction.

SPEED CORRECTION
The proportional matching of sonar recorder chart length with the over-the-ground speed of the survey vessel.
When towing side scan sonar at a constant speed over the bottom, if the image generation on the recorder or
display unit is too slow, objects in the data will appear to be compressed in the transverse dimension. If the image
generation is too fast, they will appear to be stretched.

SPEED OF SOUND
The rate at which acoustic energy moves through a medium. The speed of sound in sea water is a function of
temperature, salinity, and the changes in pressure associated with changes in depth. An increase in any of these
factors tends to increase the speed. Often incorrectly referred to as Sound Velocity - velocity is a vector and implies
direction and the speed of sound is a scalar quantity as it has no specified direction. See also Speed and Velocity.
SPHERICAL EXCESS
The amount by which the sum of the 3 angles of a triangle on a sphere exceeds 180°.

SPHEROID
A type of ellipsoid which is formed by revolving an ellipse about one of its axes. If the minor axis is the axis of
revolution, the resulting figure is called an oblate spheroid (ellipsoid) which approximates the shape of the earth.
In geodesy, this term is frequently used to mean reference spheroid.

SPIKE
Sharp deviation from a line, caused by erroneous data or an anomalous event.

SPIRE
A slender pointed structure surmounting a building such as a church. Sometimes depicted as a landmark on
nautical charts.

SPIT
A long narrow accumulation of sand or shingle, lying generally in line with the coast, with one end attached to the
land and the other projecting into the sea or across the mouth of an estuary.

SPLIT
1. In wire-drag surveying, an area between drag strips not covered by the drag. 2. In hydrographic surveying, one
or more sounding lines accomplished between mainscheme lines to provide a more detailed development or to
eliminate a holiday in coverage.

SPOIL
Mud, sand, silt, or other deposits obtained from the bottom of a body of water (usually a channel or harbor) by
dredging.

SPOIL AREA
An artificial formation created by the deposit of dredged materials on the seabed. Spoil banks that are connected to
the natural coastline are part of the baseline from which maritime zones are measured. Those that are unattached
are artificial islands and are not part of the baseline. Alternatively, spoil bank.

*Page 279*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQUAT
A change in vessel trim as it moves through the water. This change of level of the bow and stern from a still water
condition is in response to the elevation and depression of the water level about the hull resulting from the bow
and sternwave systems. Not to be confused with settlement which is the vertical displacement of a moving vessel,
relative to what its level would be were it motionless.

SSS
Acronym for Side Scan Sonar.

STACK
A tall smokestack or chimney. The term is used on nautical charts when the stack is more prominent as a landmark
than the accompanying buildings.

STAKE
An elongated wood or metal pole embedded in the bottom. A stake plotted on a hydrographic survey is assumed
to be wooden unless otherwise annotated. Its diameter is smaller than that of a pole.

STANDARD (for charts)
A file begun about 1908 by means of which a record is kept of all incoming charting information, except aids
to navigation. The file consists of a complete set of the published charts. When an individual Standard becomes
cluttered with annotations, it is filed and replaced with another chart, which then becomes the contemporary
Standard. The file is an invaluable source of historical information and is used in the preparation of project
instructions. Also called a Chart Standard.

STANDARD ERROR
The square root of the arithmetic mean of squared deviations from the mean. Also called standard deviation (when
the deviations do not represent errors) or root mean square error. In statistics, the standard error is defined as the
standard deviation of an estimate. That is, multiple measurements of a given value will generally group around
the mean (or average) value in a normal distribution. Standard error is a common measure of the uncertainty
associated with a numerical estimate. In a regression analysis, standard errors are often reported with (or below)
the coefficient estimates. As a rough rule of thumb, one can be 95% confident that the true coefficient is within ±2
standard errors of the estimate.

STANDARD PARALLEL
A parallel of latitude which is used as a control in the computation of a map projection. For a tangent cone, this is
the parallel of tangency. For a secant cone, the two parallels of intersection are the standards.
STANDPIPE
A tall cylindrical structure in a waterworks system, whose height is several times greater than its diameter. It
extends from the ground and may be supported by a skeleton-type framework. Sometimes depicted as a landmark
on nautical charts.

STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM
One of the plane rectangular coordinate systems (one for each State in the Union), established by the U.S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey in 1933 for use in defining locations of geodetic stations in terms of plane-rectangular Cartesian
coordinates.

STATUTE MILE
5280 ft, 1609.3 meters, or 80 chains. Also known as a “land mile” or “English mile.”

*Page 280*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRAIT
A relatively narrow waterway between two larger bodies of water.

STRAND
1. The portion of the seashore between high and low water line. 2. To run aground. The term strand usually refers
to a serious grounding, while the term “ground” refers to any grounding, however slight.

STRANDED
The terms “stranded” and “sunken” apply exclusively to items that once were afloat but are now resting on the bottom.
“Stranded” items project above the sounding datum, while “sunken” items do not project above the sounding
datum. These terms apply most often to wrecks. Masts, funnels, and other extensions of wreck superstructure
should be disregarded when applying the above definition; i.e., such features may project above the sounding
datum and still have the wreck classified as “sunken.” See Sunken.

STRANDING
The destruction or loss of a vessel by its being sunk or broken up by the violence of the sea or by its striking or
stranding upon a rock, shoal, etc. The term stranding refers particularly to the accidental or voluntary driving or
running aground of a vessel.

STRUCTURE
The term includes, without limitation, any pier, wharf, dolphin, weir, boom, breakwater, bulkhead, revetment,
riprap, jetty, permanent mooring structure, power transmission line, permanently moored floating vessel, pile(s),
aid to navigation, or any other obstacle or obstruction.

SUBMARINE CABLE
An insulated, waterproofed wire or bundle of wires for carrying an electric current under water. Such a cable is
placed on or near the bottom.

SUBMERGED
Under water; not showing above water (commonly used to refer to features covered at MLLW). This term applies
to objects and features that never possessed the ability to float and are now attached to, or resting on, the bottom.
All items in this category, except rocks, reefs, and rock or reef formations, are submerged if they are totally below
the shoreline datum.

SUBMERGED LANDS ACT
See Public Law 31.

SUBORDINATE GAUGE (Subordinate Water Level Station)
A water level station from which is a relatively short series of observations is reduced by comparison with
simultaneous observations from a water level station with a relatively long series of observations.
SUBSIDENCE
Sinking or down warping of a part of the earth’s surface.

SUNKEN
The terms “sunken” and “stranded” apply exclusively to items that once were afloat but are now resting on the bottom.
“Stranded” items project above the sounding datum, while “sunken” items do not project above the sounding
datum. These terms apply most often to wrecks. Masts, funnels, and other extensions of wreck superstructure
should be disregarded when applying the above definitions; i.e., such features may be above the sounding datum
and still have the wreck classified as “sunken.” See Stranded.

*Page 281*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUNKEN ROCK
A rock potentially dangerous to surface navigation, the summit of which is below the lower limit of the zone for
a rock awash. See Rock Awash.

SURDEX
An index of polygons defining the limits of sounding coverage obtained during a hydrographic survey conducted
or sponsored by the agency. The figures are contained within a geographic information system. See Survey Indices
(Indexes).

SURF
Collective term for breakers. The wave activity in the area between the shoreline and the outermost limit of breakers.
SURVEY
The act or operation of making measurements for determining the relative position of points on, above, or beneath
the Earth surface. The result of such operations.

SURVEY INDICES (INDEXES)
Printed sheets showing the dates, areas covered, and scales of planetable and hydrographic surveys along the
Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts to include Alaska and Hawaii. Historically, the indexes were maintained manually,
but in more recent times digital technology has begun to replace the system with information maintained in a
geographic information system. Also referred to as Surdex.

SWAMP
A tract of stillwater abounding in certain species of trees and course grass or boggy protuberances; a tract of wet,
spongy land, saturated, but not usually covered with water; a boggy marshland and stream.

SWATH WIDTH
The lateral coverage of sonar on the seabed. Because a sonar projects a beam(s) laterally to the vessel heading,
it creates a wide region of ensonified seafloor. Swath width changes with depth and is a factor in determining
coverage and lane spacing.

SWEEP
To drag. “Drag” and “sweep” have nearly the same meanings. In NOAA usage, a drag was typically deployed when
the objective was to locate and ascertain the minimum clearance depth over an obstruction. A sweep was used
when the objective was simply to verify that no obstructions existed in a channel or waterway. It was not effective
in determining clearance depths. See Wire Drag.

SWMB
See Shallow Water Multibeam.

SYSTEMATIC ERROR
Biases in measurement which lead to measured values being systematically too high or too low. All measurements
are prone to systematic error. A systematic error is any biasing effect, in the environment, methods of observation
or instruments used, which introduces error into an experiment and is such that it always affects the results of
an experiment in the same direction. Constant systematic errors are very difficult to deal with, because their
effects are only observable if they can be removed. Such errors cannot be removed by repeating measurements or
averaging large numbers of results. A common means to remove systematic error is the observation of a known
process, i.e. through calibration. Another means to remove systematic error is by a subsequent measurement with
more sophisticated experiment equipment.

TABLES FOR A POLYCONIC PROJECTION OF MAPS
Special Publication No. 5, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, contains the true lengths in meters of meridional arcs
and arcs of the parallel, as they appear on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, for use in the construction of projections,
together with the “x, y “ coordinates for plotting the intersection of parallels and meridians in constructing a
polyconic projection. The tables are based on the legal value of the meter in the United States, which is 39.3700
inches, and corresponds to 1 m = 3.2808333 ft and 1 ft = 0.3048006 meters. Also referred to as Table of Meridional
Parts.

TAGLINE
A line, either marked at equal intervals or run over a registered sheave, used in large-scale surveys to take equally
spaced soundings at predetermined distances from a control station or known location, e.g., a pier face.
TANK
In NOAA usage, a fixed structure for storing liquids. Sometimes depicted as a landmark on nautical charts.
TERMINAL MORAINE
A moraine formed across the course of a glacier at its farthest advance, at or near a relatively stationary edge, or at
places marking the termination of important glacial advances.

TERRITORIAL LIMITS
The seaward or most offshore limits of a littoral or coastal nation over which it has exclusive jurisdiction.
TERRITORIAL SEA
The water area bordering a nation over which it has exclusive jurisdiction, except for the right of innocent passage
of foreign vessels. It extends seaward from the low-water mark along a straight coast and from the seaward limits
of inland waters where there are embayments. These waters commonly extend to 12 nautical miles from the coast,
per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

TERRITORIAL WATERS
Includes the territorial sea (marginal seas) and the inland waters of a country (lakes, rivers, and bays, etc.).
Sometimes used as synonymous with Territorial Sea.

TERTIARY GAUGE (Tertiary Tide Station)
A water level station at which continuous observations have been made over a minimum period of 30 days but less
than 1 year. The series is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a secondary control water
level station. This station provides for a 29-day harmonic analysis.

THEODOLITE
A precise surveying instrument, consisting of an alidade with a telescope mounted so that it can be rotated about a
vertical axis; the amount of rotation is measured on an accurately graduated, stationary horizontal circle. See also
transit.

THERMOCLINE
A layer of water where the vertical temperature gradient is greater than that in the water above it or in the water
below it. Thermoclines affect the ray path of acoustic signals underwater and can result in a range-limiting type
of banding visible in side scan sonar data. Similar to the effects of a haline front, this banding is most evident at
the outer ranges of sonar data where the beam’s angle of incidence to the thermocline is high. Changing the sonar
geometry will minimize or eliminate the effects of thermoclines.

*Page 283*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THREE-ARM PROTRACTOR
An instrument (metal or plastic) for plotting sextant fixes in hydrographic surveying. It consists of a graduated
circle with a fixed center arm and right and left movable arms pivoted at its center so that the extension of each
fiducial edge always passes through the precise center of the graduated circle. The observed left angle is set with the
left arm and the right angle with the right arm, and each fiducial edge is made to pass through the corresponding
control station on the survey sheet. The center of the protractor marks the position of the survey boat.
THREE POINT FIX METHOD
One of the principal methods used historically on inshore hydrographic surveys for establishing the position of
the survey boat. It involves the measurement with sextants of two angles between three known stations, the middle
station being common to both angles, and plotting the boat’s position graphically with a three-arm protractor.
TIDAL BENCH MARK
A bench mark near a tide station to which the tide staff and tidal datums are referred.

TIDAL DATUM
A base elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths specifically defined in terms of a
certain phase of the tide. Tidal datums are local datums and should not be extended into areas which have differing
hydrographic characteristics with substantiating measurements.

TIDE
The periodic rise and fall of the water resulting from gravitational interactions between Sun, Moon and Earth. The
vertical component of the particulate motion of a tidal wave.

TIDE GAUGE
Also referred to as a water level gauge. A device for measuring actual water levels. It can be a simple as a graduated
staff in the water where visual observations can be made or it may consist of an elaborate recording instrument
making a continuous graphic record of water levels over time. Until recent technological advances, most tide
gauges were actuated by a float in a pipe communicating with the sea through a small hole which filters out shorter
waves.

TIDE LANDS
The zone between the mean high-water line and the mean low-water line, commonly referred to as the “beach.”
Waters above the tidelands are inland, being landward of the coastline.

TIDE RANGE
See Range of Tide.

TIDE STATION
See water level station.

TIME VARIED GAIN (TVG)
A process where amplifier gain is changed based on time and matched with the returning signals between outgoing
pulses of a sonar. Because of attenuation of a sonar beam, the receiver gain must be increased as the acoustic
returns from greater and greater distances arrive at the transducer. Because these returns are received over a
predictable and consistent time, the gains can be increased over a time curve. In many sonar systems, this curve
can be adjusted by the operator.

TOP MARK
A characteristic shape secured at the top of a buoy or beacon to aid in its identification.

*Page 284*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOPOGRAPHIC MAP
A map which presents the vertical position of features in measurable form, as well as their horizontal positions.
TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY
As used in NOAA, a record of a survey, of a given date, of the natural features and the culture of a portion of the
land surface and their delineation by means of conventional symbols. Alternately, it is the original field survey
sheet and is the authority for the high-water line and all information inshore of that line, including geographic
names of topographic features.

TOTAL PROPAGATED Uncertainty(TPU)
TPU is an estimate of the uncertainty of any individual sounding, taking into account the error estimates of the
component measurements (tide, sound speed, draft, range measurement, angle measurement, attitude, offsets,
etc), and expressed as a separate value in horizontal and vertical planes. The uncertainty is sometimes expressed
as a variance (in meters2) but more often as a confidence level (in meters) based on the assumption that the
uncertainty is a Gaussian distribution. In the latter case, a specification of the level of confidence (e.g., “at 95%
CI”’) must be appended for correctness and completeness. Horizontal uncertainties are generally expressed as a
single ’Circular Error Probable’ (CEP) value implying a symmetric distribution of uncertainty in the plane. Note
that ‘error’ could be considered a misnomer, as there is no implication that the sounding is incorrect, just that its
true value is uncertain.

TP SHEET (MAP)
The term “TP Sheet” refers to photogrammetric surveys planned and executed after 1968. Photogrammetric
surveys of the “TP” series are graphically depicted in the form of a shoreline map. Shoreline maps of the “TP”
series generally depict shoreline in detail. In special survey projects, the shoreline map may consist of the base map
and one or more overlays. “TP” stands for Topographic Photogrammetry.

TRACK
The actual path or route of a craft over the ground or sea bottom, or its graphic representation.
TRAINING WALL
A structure built alongside a channel to direct the tidal stream or currents through the channel to promote a
scouring action.

TRANSDUCER
The electromechanical component of a sonar system that is mounted underwater and converts electrical energy
to sound energy and vice versa. The transducer formation determines the beam shape and is the basis for image
formation in side scan sonar.

TRANSFORM
To change the form of data according to specified rules, without significantly changing the meaning of the data.
TRANSIT
A surveying instrument composed of a horizontal circle graduated in circular measure and an alidade with a
telescope which can be reversed in its supports without being lifted therefrom. Also, the act of making such
reversal. A theodolite having a telescope that can be transited in its supports is a transit, and is sometimes termed
a transit theodolite. All modern theodolites are transits. See theodolite.

TRANSVERSE MERCATOR PROJECTION
A projection of the cylindrical type, being in principle equivalent to the regular Mercator Projection turned 90°

*Page 285*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in azimuth. In this projection, the central meridian is represented by a straight line, corresponding to the line
which represents the equator on the regular Mercator Projection. Neither the geographic meridians, except the
central meridian, nor the geodetic parallels, except the equator (if shown), are represented by straight lines. It is a
conformal projection. Also called transverse cylindrical orthomorphic projection.

TRANSVERSE RESOLUTION
The ability of the sonar to image, as separate and distinct, objects that lay in a line parallel with a side scan sonar
towfish track. Transverse or along-track resolution is determined, in part, by the horizontal beam width of the
sonar. A narrow beam width will display two targets close together as separate and distinct anomalies. The same
two targets, when ensonified by a wider beam, can be simultaneously enveloped by the single outgoing pulse. This
can result in the two objects appearing as one in the sonar display. Transverse resolution decreases with range from
the towfish because of beam spreading.

TRAVERSE
A route and a sequence of points on it at which observations are made; or the route, the points, and the observations
at those points; or the process by which the route and sequence are established. In particular, a survey traverse.
Unless specifically stated otherwise, a traverse is horizontal, i.e., a procedure for determining only the horizontal
coordinates of the points in the traverse.

TRIANGULATION
A method of surveying in which the stations are points on the ground at the vertices of a chain or network of
triangles, whose angles are observed instrumentally and whose sides are derived by computation from selected
triangle sides called base lines, the lengths of which are obtained from direct measurement on the ground.
TRILATERATION
A method of extending horizontal control where the sides of triangles are measured rather than the angles as in
triangulation.

TRIGGER PULSE
The signal provided to sonar transducer firing circuitry to initiate the outgoing pulse; also, two parallel lines on the
center of a side scan sonar record that represent the position of the fish in relation to the sonar image. Many sonar
displays sense the trigger pulse in order to synchronize other subroutines with the trigger. Because the display of
the trigger pulse in data is caused by transducer firing, it is useful in system troubleshooting.
TRUE NORTH
Geographic or astronomic north; coincides with the true meridian rather than magnetic north.

T- SHEET
Planetable topographic and certain photogrammetric surveys conducted by the agency and its predecessors during
the period 1834 - 1980. These surveys were recorded graphically in the form of a map which should be referred to
a “topographic survey” or “shoreline map,” as appropriate.

TURBIDITY
Reduced water clarity resulting from the presence of suspended matter. Water is considered turbid when its load
of suspended matter is visibly conspicuous, but all waters contain some suspended matter and therefore are turbid.
As turbidity increases, the maximum depth that water penetrating bathymetric LIDAR can measure decreases.
TURNING BASIN
A water area used for turning vessels.

*Page 286*

TVG
See Time Varied Gain.

TWO POINT FEATURE
A cartographic feature that can be positioned with 1 set of coordinates describing its location and a second set of
coordinates defining its orientation.

7.21 U
-------

UNALASKA DATUM
An independent datum in Alaska used along the south coast of the Alaska Peninsula from Cape Kuyuyukak to
Umnak Island.

UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM
The first standard geographic datum adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for all the triangulation in the
United States. It was adopted on March 13, 1901, and is defined by station Meades Ranch, whose position on the
Clarke spheroid of 1866 is: Latitude 39° 13’ 26.686”, longitude 98° 32’ 30.506”, and azimuth to station Waldo 75°
28’ 14.52”.

UNIVERSAL TRANSVERSE MERCATOR (UTM) GRID
A military grid system based on the transverse Mercator map projection, applied to maps of the earth’s surface
extending to 84°N and 80°S.

UPPER LIMIT OF NAVIGATION
The character of a river will, at some point along its length, change from navigable to non-navigable. Very often that
point will be at a major fall or rapids, or other place where there is a marked decrease in the navigable capacity of
the river. The upper limit will therefore often be the same point traditionally recognized as the head of navigation,
but may, under some of the tests described above, be at some point yet farther upstream.

UUV
Acronym for Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. There are two categories of UUVs, AUVs and ROVs. See AUV and
ROV.

7.22 V
-------

VALDEZ DATUM
Vicinity of Cape St. Elias to Wide Bay on the Alaska Peninsula, and for the triangulation around Kodiak sland.
VARIATION
The angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or
west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. Also called magnetic declination.
VELOCIMETER
Same as Velocity Profiler.

VELOCITY
A vector quantity equal to speed in a given direction.

*Page 287*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VELOCITY PROFILE
The gradient of acoustic velocity in water displayed as a graph of distance below the sea surface against the speed of
sound. This term is often used incorrectly instead of speed-of-sound profile, when referring to a scalar magnitude
rather than a vector quantity.

VELOCITY PROFILER
An instrument used for the “in situ” measurement of the speed-of-sound in the sea and other natural waters. Also
called velocimeter.

VERIFICATION
As used in NOAA, the process by which a hydrographic survey undergoes a check of the field observations. It
deals primarily with a specific survey and its accompanying records, and with correlating it to other contemporary
surveys.

VERIFIED WATER LEVELS
Recorded 6-minute water level observations that have undergone both rudimentary data consistency checks in
the CO-OPS Data Processing and Analysis System (DPAS) and verification by a technician at CO-OPS. Any gaps
in data will have been recovered or interpolated from other gauge data. Verified water levels have been reduced to
MLLW.

VERIFIER’S REPORT
The renamed, but approximately equivalent, successor to the “Review Report.” On the transfer of the formal
hydrographic survey review to the Office of Marine Operations in October, 1975, it was considered appropriate
to revise the title of the report, although the format and content remained essentially unaltered. Effective October
1,1982, the title of this report was again revised to “Evaluation Report.” The “Review Report,” “Verifier’s Report,”
and “Evaluation Report” are essentially equivalent documents, i.e., they serve the same purpose. See Evaluation
Report and Review Report.

VERTICAL BEAM ECHO SOUNDER (VBES)
A term created by NOAA hydrographers to identify the dual-frequency, dual beam width nature of nonmultibeam
depth measuring sonars. Although the transducer of Vertical Beam Echo Sounders is not gyro-stabilized (a
requirement for a true single beam vertical echo sounder) it is assumed that through all vessel motions where
depth measurements are taken a portion of the wider beam is indeed vertical. See Single Beam Echo Sounder
(SBES)
VERTICAL CONTROL
Term used to describe points with established elevations relative to a specific vertical datum which are used as
fixed references for surveying and/or mapping activities.

VERTICAL DATUM
Any level surface taken as a surface of reference from which to reckon elevations. A level surface is one which,
at every point, is perpendicular to the direction of gravity, i.e., an equipotential surface. The geoid, or in general,
any surface parallel to it, is a level surface. In order that they may be recovered when needed, such datums are
referenced to fixed points known as bench marks.

VESSEL
The term “vessel” includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being
used, as a means of transportation on the waters of the U.S.

*Page 288*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VESSEL CONFIGURATION FILE (VCF)
A digital file used to set the parameters for sensors and other equipment for data processing. See HIPS Vessel File
(HVF)
VESSEL REFERENCE UNIT (VRU)
See Motion Reference Unit (MRU).

7.23 W
-------

W SURVEY
A hydrographic survey originating from outside the administrative control of the agency; alternately referred to
as outside source data. These data are considered to have the potential to be applied to nautical charts. They are
assigned a registry number consisting of the “W” prefix followed by a 5-digit numerical identifier, e.g., W00001.
WAAS
See Wide Area Augmentation System.

WATER COLUMN
A vertical section of water from the surface to the bottom. Typically used when describing sonar performance,
characteristics, and corrections.

WATER LEVEL GAUGE
See Tide Gauge.

WATER LEVEL STATION
The geographic location at which water level observations are conducted. Also, the facilities used to make water
level observations. These may include a tide house, tide gauge, tide stall, and tidal bench marks. Also referred to
as a tide station.

WATERFRONT
Land at the end of a stream, harbor, etc.; the part of a city or town on such land; a wharf or dock area.
WATERLINE
1. The line marking the junction of water and land. This line migrates, changing with the tide or other variation of
the water level. Also written as two words. 2. The line marking the junction of water and the hull of a vessel.
WATERWAY
A water area providing a means of transportation from one place to another, principally a water area providing a
regular route for water traffic, such as a bay, channel, passage, or the regularly traveled parts of the open sea. The
terms waterway, fairway, and thoroughfare have nearly the same meanings. Waterway refers particularly to the
navigable part of the water area. Fairway refers to the main traveled part of a waterway. A thoroughfare is a public
waterway.

WAVELENGTH
The distance, measured in the direction of propagation, between 2 successive points in a wave that are characterized
by the same phase of oscillation. In sonar technology, along with the transmit power of a sonar, the wavelength
(directly related to sonar frequency) will determine the ultimate range of the system. Decreases in wavelength
(increases in frequency) bring higher resolution with the tradeoff of reduced range.

*Page 289*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAY POINT
1. A mark or place at which a vessel is required to report or establish its position. 2. A notable point, often the point
at which course changes, in a planned vessel route.

WD
See Wire Drag.

WEIR
A fence-like structure set in a stream or along a shoreline to catch fish. It differs from a pound because it is mainly
constructed of brush hedging or narrow boards with or without nettings. Coastal weirs are generally built where
there is a large expanse of ground left uncovered at low water. Weirs are usually kept in position all year round.
WELL HEAD
A submarine structure projecting some distance above the seabed and capping an oil or gas well on which drilling
activity has been temporarily abandoned or suspended.

WHARF
A structure of open, rather than solid, construction parallel to the shoreline, providing only one face, which serves
as a berthing place for vessels, and which generally provides cargo-handling facilities. A similar facility of solid
construction is called a quay. A structure extending into the water with accommodations for vessels on both sides
is called a pier.

WIDE AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS)
The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a network of 25 ground reference stations, ranging from the US to
Canada to Mexico, which monitor GPS satellite information and create a GPS correction message. This correction
accounts for GPS satellite orbit and clock drift plus signal delays caused by the atmosphere and ionosphere. The
corrected differential message is then broadcast through one of two geostationary satellites, or satellites with a fixed
position over the equator. A WAAS-corrected signal can result in a GPS positional accuracy of within 3 meters.
WINTER MARKER
A lighted or unlighted buoy without sound signal, which is established as a replacement during the winter months
when other aids are closed or withdrawn due to potential severe weather conditions such as ice.

WIRE DRAG
An apparatus once used in hydrographic surveying for determining the maximum clearance depth. It also was
used for the detection of isolated dangers to navigation which might escape detection by ordinary sounding
methods, e.g., rocks, pinnacles, ledges, boulders, coral reefs, etc. It consisted of a horizontal bottom wire supported
at intervals ranging from 300 - 600 ft by adjustable upright cables suspended from buoys on the surface and towed
at the desired depth by 2 ships or launches. These uprights could be lengthened or shortened for various required
depths. They were kept in a nearly vertical position by means of weights attached to their ends. The end weights
and buoys were larger than the intermediate weights, and buoys and the towing gear was attached to them.
WIRE-DRAGGED AREAS
Areas that have been swept to a safe depth with the wire drag. Symbolized on nautical/navigational charts by a
green tint.

WIRE-DRAG SURVEY
A hydrographic survey utilizing wire drag apparatus.

*Page 290*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WIRE SWEEP
A modification of the wire-drag apparatus. Drag and sweep have nearly the same meanings. The wire sweep
was similar to the wire drag, differing only in the length of dragged sections between buoys. It consisted of end
buoys and intermediate buoys set at intervals of 2,000 - 2,500 ft. It was used in areas where the general depth was
considerably greater than the depths to be investigated and where few, if any, obstructions were believed to exist.
The sweep could be set out more quickly and required less equipment than the wire-drag apparatus. The use of
the sweep would not necessarily indicate closely the position of any obstruction encountered, due to the great
distances between buoys. In addition, the sweep depth would be only an approximation because of the sag of the
bottom-wire between buoys.

WORLD GEODETIC SYSTEM 1984 (WGS 84)
WGS 84 is comprised of a consistent set of parameters describing the size and shape of the earth, the positions of
a network of points with respect to the center of mass of the earth, transformations form major geodetic datums,
and the potential of the earth. It represents the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA’s) modeling from a
geometric, geodetic, and gravitational standpoint using data, techniques, and technology available in 1984. Satellite
positions, including GPS observations, are based on WGS 84 which is both an ellipsoid and a datum.
WRECK
The ruined remains of a vessel which has been rendered useless, usually by violent action of the sea and weather,
on a stranded or sunken vessel. In hydrography, the term is limited to a wrecked vessel, either submerged or visible,
which is attached to or afoul of the bottom or cast up on the shore. In nautical cartography, wrecks are designated
visible, dangerous, or non-dangerous according to whether they are above tidal datum, less than, or more than 20
m (66 ft; 11 fm) below tidal datum, respectively.

WRECKAGE
Goods or parts of a wrecked vessel either washed ashore, afloat, or submerged and resting on the bottom; i.e., the
remains of a wreck.

WRECK BUOY
A buoy marking the position of a wreck. It is usually placed on the seaward or channel side of the wreck and as
near to the wreck as conditions will permit. To avoid confusion in some situations, 2 buoys may be used to mark
the wreck. The possibility of the wreck having shifted position due to sea action between the times the buoy was
established and later checked or serviced should not be overlooked.

7.24 X
-------

X-AXIS
A horizontal axis in a system of rectangular coordinates; that line on which distances to the right or left (east or
west) of the reference line are marked, especially on a map, chart, or graph.

7.25 Y
-------

Y-AXIS
A vertical axis in a system of rectangular coordinates; that line on which distances above or below (north or south
of) a reference line are marked, especially on a map, chart, or graph. The line which is perpendicular to the X-axis
and passes through the origin.

*Page 291*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YARD
A fundamental unit of length in the English system of measurement. The metric equivalent prior to July 1, 1959,
was 1 yd = 0.914440183 m. On that date, the value was changed to 1 yd = 0.9144 m.

YAW
An instability characterized by the side-to-side movement of a ship or towed body about its vertical axis. Vessel
and towfish yaw most often occur at low speeds and with quartering seas. Towfish yaw is distinctive in sonar data.

7.26 Z
-------

“ZERO” SOUNDINGS
Soundings that reduce to heights above the sounding datum but are shown on the smooth sheet as zero soundings,
regardless of height; a practice followed prior to 1860.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
The POS/MV uses a Right-Hand Orthogonal Reference System
The right-hand orthogonal system defines the following:
* The x-axis is in the fore-aft direction in the appropriate reference frame.

* The y-axis is perpendicular to the x-axis and points towards the
right (starboard) side in the appropriate reference frame.

* The z-axis points downwards in the appropriate reference frame.

The POS/MV uses a Tate-Bryant Rotation Sequence
Apply the rotation in the following order to bring the two frames of reference
into complete alignment:
a) Heading rotation - apply a right-hand screw rotation θz about the
z-axis to align one frame with the other.

b) Pitch rotation - apply a right-hand screw rotation θy about the
once-rotated y-axis to align one frame with the other.

c) Roll rotation - apply a right-hand screw rotation θx about the
twice-rotated x-axis to align one frame with the other.

DIRECTIONS FOR CREATING
TRADITIONAL LEAD LINES AND SOUNDING POLES

(excerpted from the NOAA Hydrographic Manual, July 1976, with modifications)

Traditional Lead Line Construction
I. Material
Standard lead line material is mahogany-colored tiller rope with a phosphor-bronze wire
center. The center consists of six strands of seven 33-B (S-gage) wires each. The wire core is
flexible and should not break after continual use and coiling. The rope is size 8 (about 0.24
in. in diameter), and is made of waterproofed, solid braided, long-staple cotton. The braid
should be tight enough so that broken wire strands will not protrude through the covering
and injure a leadsman's hands. Material for lead lines may either be requisitioned from the
Marine Centers or be purchased from a well-equipped marine supply dealer.

II. Fabrication and Marking
Depending on the depths in which they will be used and on the size of the vessel, lead lines
should be 30 to 60 meters long. Each lead line is identified by a consecutive number
stamped on a metal disk attached at the inboard end of the line. Identification is made when
a line is initially graduated. This number is to be retained throughout the life of the lead line
or until re-marking is necessary. The braided covering of an unseasoned lead line tends to
shrink when wet causing the wire core to buckle and the strands to break. Broken strands are
likely to protrude through the covering and cause hand injuries. To prevent rupturing the
core with repeated use, pre-season each lead line as follows:
1. Prepare the lead line by soaking it in salt water for 24 hours. Then, while the line is still
wet, work the cotton covering along the wire by hand until the wire protrudes from the
covering. The wire should protrude about 1/3 meter for each 20 meters of line. This is a
tedious procedure requiring the cooperative efforts of several people. The covering can be
pushed back and slackened only a few inches at a time; this length of slack must be pushed
nearly the full length of the line before the next small section can be started. The excess
protruding wire is cut off. The covering must not be worked back too far, or it will form
bulges along the wire. Lead lines so prepared will maintain an almost constant length for
future use.

2. Next, the line is dried under tension (about 50 lb) and then soaked again for 24 hr. Never
boil a lead line as this destroys the waterproofing of the cover.

3. After attaching a lead to the line, the line should be wetted down again and placed under a
tension equal to the weight of the lead; this tension is maintained while the line is being
graduated. Temporary marks made at this time can be used for later permanent marking.

Graduation marks on a new lead line may be laid off with a steel tape. The best method,
however, is to mark the distances permanently on a suitable surface such as on the deck of a
ship or on a wharf if the survey party is shore based. Permanent markings are convenient
when verifying the graduations in the future. Lead lines for NOAA hydrographic surveys
should be graduated in meters, with intermediate marks to permit readings to the nearest
decimeter. Each meter should be marked by a seizing of black thread, with a leather strip
clearly indicating the numerical value for even meter intervals. Each even decimeter (0.2,

0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) is marked by a seizing of white thread. Odd tenth readings are estimated.

Waxed linen thread should be used to secure marks to the lead line in such a manner that
there can be no possibility of slippage. Do not insert the thread through the braided
covering of the line.

III. Verification
When checks of traditional lead lines are made, the lead lines must be wet and under a
tension equal to the weight of the attached lead in water. The testing standard should be a
good recently calibrated steel tape or pre-measured graduation marks on deck or ashore.

Replace or re-mark lead lines if the errors exceed 0.1 meter.

IV. Sounding Leads
Each survey unit should have one or more leads. Leads come in standard weights of 5, 7, 9,
14, and 25 lb are requisitioned from the Marine Centers. Various methods may be used to
attach the lead to the lead line. The preferred method is to have a galvanized thimble at the
lower end of the lead line to which the lead can be attached by a shackle.

Traditional Sounding Pole Construction
I. Material
A sounding pole is made from a 5 meter length of 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) round lumber capped
with a weighted metal shoe at each end to hasten sinking. Shorter poles may be used
depending on the depth conditions.

II. Fabrication and Marking
Any convenient system of marking that is symmetrical toward both ends and will minimize
reading errors may be used. The following marking system is recommended:
Mark each meter and even decimeter graduation (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) permanently by
cutting a small notch in the pole. Paint the entire pole white; then paint odd decimeter
graduation marks black.

III. Verification
Sounding poles must be verified against a known standard, such as a survey quality metal
tape, to ensure that depth markings are unambiguous and accurate.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Jeff Ferguson
Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division or
Howard Danley
Chief, Navigation Services Division

FROM:

LCDR Joseph Hydrohead, NOAA
Commanding Officer, NOAA Ship SWATH

SUBJECT:

NOAA Ship SWATH Hydrographic Systems Status Summary

The hydrographic systems of NOAA Ship SWATH were reviewed in accordance with the Office of
Coast Survey Field Procedures Manual (FPM) Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review procedures
on January 28, 2010. The review process took place at NOAA’s Marine Operations Center in
Norfolk, Virginia, and was conducted by a Hydrographic Systems Review Team comprised of the
following people:
Lieutenant Jane Doe, HSTP Field Support Liaison
Lieutenant Ida Know, Field Operations Officer, NOAA Ship SWATH
Mr. Thomas Smith, Physical Scientist, AHB
The Review Team’s findings are summarized in this memorandum and reflect the condition of the
SWATH field unit’s hydrographic systems on the review date. These findings have been divided
into three categories of deficiencies:
CATEGORY 1 – These deficiencies indicate the failure or absence of vital equipment or
preparations of systems essential to acquisition and/or processing of hydrographic data. The vessel
will be required to cease or limit hydrographic survey operations due to the following deficiencies:
1. The hull of launch number 2901 has structurally cracked and the vessel has been removed
from service until repairs are made. This vessel should not be used for hydrographic survey
operations until the crack has been repaired.

2. The ship’s multibeam echosounder (MBES) was replaced during the current dockside repair
period. A calibration (patch test) has not yet been conducted for this system due to ongoing
ship repairs. The ship’s MBES system can not be used to acquire data for NOAA
hydrographic surveys until a successful system calibration has been performed.

3. Side scan sonar (SSS) towfish S/N 8675309 failed to detect the 1 m3 test object nine out of
ten times during calibration. No evidence of damage was noted on the towfish. After three
unsuccessful attempts to complete the SSS calibration, EED was contacted and the towfish

Comment [J1]: This memo is to be submitted as
a digitally signed PDF document. Email a copy of
this memo to OCS.HSRR@noaa.gov

returned to the manufacturer for evaluation and any necessary repairs. Towfish repairs had
not been completed at the time of this review.

CATEGORY 2 – These deficiencies indicate noncompliance with established policies, directives,
instructions, or accepted hydrographic practice not addressed under Category 1. The following
deficiencies shall be corrected in as timely a manner as funding, time, and/or professional assistance
permit:
1. The field unit’s Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG) is overdue for calibration. This system
must be calibrated by the manufacturer annually.

2. The side scan cable counter on Launch 2902 is broken, and the cable has been manually
marked. These markings are deteriorating and no longer considered accurate. An accurate
method of measuring cable out is required for side scan operations.

3. To analyze a horizontal control reference station, a second portable DGPS reference station
is needed for comparison. SWATH is not equipped to set up a second portable DGPS
reference station due to loss of equipment during the 2004 field season.

4. The field unit is currently performing GIS functions using MapInfo version 6.5. While this
software version will perform locally without problems, OCS has upgraded to version 8.0.

Project files and workspaces created using MapInfo version 8.0 may not be compatible with
version 6.5.

CATEGORY 3 – These deficiencies are associated with observations during the course of the
review which merit consideration for corrective actions. These observations are included for review
and dialogue related to potential problem areas and hydrographic operational efficiency. It is
important to assure that resources (funds, skills, and time) are available at the operating level in
order to meet the needs identified in this report and to sustain the efficient operation, upkeep, and
repair of the field unit’s hydrographic systems.

1. Offset measurement and dynamic draft measurements for SWATH have not been
completed for 2006. The ship intends to operate for the 2006 field season using historical
values determined when the ship’s Elac 1050D MBES was installed. Based in the inherent
inaccuracy of the Elac system and the more relaxed requirements of IHO S-44 Order 2
surveying for which it is employed, the field unit considers historical offset and dynamic
draft values to be adequate.

2. Launch 2901 is equipped with a POS/MV version 3 system. The review team recommends
that this system be upgraded to a version 4 system so that Precise Timing methods can be
implemented with the launch’s Reson 8125 MBES system.

Dear Ms. Henson,
I am forwarding for tort claim action the attached claim for damages to fishing gear submitted by Mr. Bob
Fishman, captain and owner of the F/V Lollipop, for the amount of $1,000.00. The damages and loss of
his fixed lobster fishing gear occurred on September 3, 2013 during hydrographic survey operations
conducted by the NOAA Ship Ferdinand R. Hassler in the area of the approaches to Portsmouth, NH. I
have evaluated this claim using track-line information provided by the Hassler command. Based on this
information, I find the claim to be reasonable and just. I recommend Mr. Fishman be reimbursed for the
requested amount. Please charge this claim to the accounting code XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

I have attached the information submitted by Mr. Fishman and the corresponding track-line information
from the Hassler. If additional information is required, please contact me directly; I can be reached by email at brent.pounds@noaa.gov or my phone at (401)782-3252 (office) or (401)545-0174 (cell).

Dear Mr. Dellinger,

 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ship Thomas Jefferson will be conducting
hydrographic survey operations in Block Island Sound and Long Island Sound that will take place during May –
November, 2013.

 
A map showing the planned survey area(s) is included on the following page. These planned survey operations
are subject to change due to weather and logistical constraints. It is the intent of the NOAA to coordinate with
local regulatory authorities and lobstermen so survey operations can be conducted with minimal interference to
lobster fishing.

 
A hydrographic survey of this type requires that Thomas Jefferson tow a side scan sonar towfish approximately
20 to 60 feet off the bottom in some areas of this region. The towfish is approximately five feet in length, five
inches in diameter, and towed by a cable. Side scan sonar and multibeam sonar systems will acquire detailed
data of the bottom, delineating and obtaining least depths of potential hazards to navigation. Multibeam sonar
data will be collected by two 29-foot aluminum survey launches. Please Note: These survey launches do not
tow any sonar equipment. Their sonar equipment is rigidly mounted to the aluminum hulls.

 
It is understood that a high density of pots may be in the area during the survey operations. The personnel of
Thomas Jefferson will exercise every caution while surveying to avoid entanglement of lobster pots. If a lobster
pot does become entangled, Thomas Jefferson will immediately take action to stop the vessel and clear the pot
lines from the sonar gear. In previous survey projects, coordination with local lobstermen allowed us to
postpone certain areas of the survey knowing the lobster traps were to be moved at a later time frame. This
coordination works out well for both survey operations and the lobstermen.

 
If you have any questions on the survey operations or general comments on how we may approach an
effective coordination effort, please contact our Navigation Manager for the Northeast, LCDR Brent
Pounds at (401) 782-3252 or via e-mail: Brent.Pounds@noaa.gov. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

RE:

NOAA Employees’ Immunity from State Prosecution

QUESTION PRESENTED & BRIEF ANSWER
You have asked whether a State has the authority to stop and board a NOAA vessel and
arrest a NOAA corps officer for alleged violations of a State law, where the vessel and its
crew are engaged in operations authorized by Federal law. 1 As described more fully
below, we have determined that the State lacks such authority absent extraordinary
circumstances. Our research was informed by discussions with attorneys from the
Department of Commerce and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice,
the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston.

DISCUSSION
Under normal circumstances, a State cannot seize or board a Federal vessel. Vessels or
cargo of the United States are exempt from civil seizure pursuant to the Suits In
Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. 30908. In addition, a State may not detain and/or prosecute a
NOAA officer – or indeed any Federal employee – serving on a NOAA vessel when they
are engaged in the performance of their duty. Such action is barred by the so-called
“Supremacy Clause” of the U.S. Constitution:

*Page 1*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question arose out of a situation near Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, where the NOAA Ship
Thomas Jefferson is performing a survey mission. After local lobstermen complained of lost gear
– allegedly damaged by the Thomas Jefferson – the NOAA Office of General Counsel was
contacted by counsel for the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries, who stated that the
complaints, if proven, showed a violation of Massachusetts law. See Mass. Ann Laws, Ch. 130,
31 (2007) (“Whoever without the consent of the owner . . . destroys, injures or molests any . . .
lobster or crab pot or other fishing gear . . , shall be punished by a fine of not less than five
hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for two months, or both..”).

After lobstermen threatened to request the Massachusetts Environmental Police seize the Thomas
Jefferson and arrest its Commanding Officer, our office was contacted to determine whether the
State, in fact, had authority to take such action. This situation is used as a case study in the
following analysis.

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in
pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and Judges
in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of
the State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2.

Thus a State may not enforce laws impeding Federal law, and in many circumstances,
Federal officials are immune from State prosecution when carrying out Federal laws. As
the Supreme Court stated over a century ago:
…if the prisoner is held in the state court to answer for an act which he was
authorized to do by the law of the United States, which it was his duty to do as
marshal of the United States, and if in so doing that act he did not more than what
was necessary and proper for him to do, he cannot be guilty of a crime under the
law of the State of California. When these things are shown, it is established that
he is innocent of any crime against the laws of the State, or of any other authority
whatever.

In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 75 (1890). 2
This immunity applies, under the circumstances described in Neagle, despite the lack of
an explicit grant of immunity in the Federal law under which the Federal employee acts.

"It is not necessary for Congress to provide expressly for such immunity in the statutes
under which federal officials act; Supremacy Clause immunity is 'incidental to, and is
implied in the several acts by which these [federal] institutions are created, and is secured
to the individuals employed in them, by the judicial power alone.'" Wyoming v.

Livingston, 443 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2006), quoting Osborn v. Bank of United
States, 22 U.S. 738, 865-866 (1824).

Neagle thus provides a two-part test for Federal employee immunity under the
Supremacy Clause:
1. Is the Federal employee acting within his authority under Federal law? and
2.) Did the employee do no more than what was necessary and proper for him to
do in fulfilling his duty?
The first part of the Neagle test is relatively straightforward: Did the Federal employee’s
alleged violation of State law take place while he was performing an action which he was
authorized to do under Federal law? Many cases examining this question deal with

*Page 2*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neagle was a Federal marshal who was charged by the State of California for killing the attacker
of a Federal judge whom Neagle was protecting pursuant to orders from his superiors. Neagle
was discharged from State custody by a Federal writ of habeas corpus.

*Page 2*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal law enforcement officials charged with (and held to have immunity from) State
crimes such as murder 3 and bribery. 4 In one notable case, the Supreme Court affirmed
the immunity of a Federal administrator of a disabled Civil War soldiers’ facility charged
under State law with the offense of serving oleomargarine without posting notice of the
fact. The Court noted that while the grounds of the facility were within State jurisdiction,
the Federal administrator of the soldiers’ home served food to the residents under the
authority of federal provisioning statutes, and therefore was able to provide the
oleomargarine without notice, notwithstanding State law. Ohio v. Thomas, 173 U.S. 276,
285 (1899). More recently, Federal Fish and Wildlife employees were found to be
immune from state prosecution for trespassing on private land (in violation of state
statutes) during the federal employees’ activities in tagging wild wolves pursuant to a
federal statute for reintroduction of the wolves in the West. Livingston, supra at 1222.

With respect the Cape Cod Bay situation, the Thomas Jefferson is conducting surveys
pursuant to Federal authority provided in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, 33 U.S.C.

883a et seq. This statute provides the Secretary of Commerce – and those to whom he
delegates his authority – with the authority to conduct surveys for navigational, scientific
and other purposes. See 33 U.S.C. 883a. Moreover, “[t]he President is authorized to
cause to be employed such of the public vessels as he deems it expedient to employ, and
to give such instructions for regulating their conduct as he deems proper in order to carry
out the provisions of this Act [33 USCS §§ 883a-883i],” see 33 U.S.C. 883h. The
Hydrographic Services Improvement Act further confirms this authority in mandatory
language, stating “the Administrator [of NOAA] shall…acquire and disseminate
hydrographic data.” See 33 U.S.C. 892a(a)(1). The NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson,
pursuant to this authority, is conducting the Cape Cod Bay Right Whale Route survey in
accordance with Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions -- project number M-A902TJ/GM-07. This satisfies the first element of the Neagle test.
The second element of the Neagle test is more nuanced: Was the Federal employee
doing no more than what was necessary and proper for him to do in fulfilling his duty,
when the alleged State law violation took place? In finding what is “necessary and
proper,” courts look at the specific circumstances surrounding the Federal employee’s
behavior in carrying out his Federally authorized duty. This examination is fact-specific
and courts have shied away from a one-size-fits-all definition of what “necessary and
proper” behavior is. Rather, courts have adopted a “reasonableness” standard to gauge
what activities are necessary and proper: “The substance of the standards applied … is
that of honest and reasonable belief. If … [the Federal employee] shows without dispute
that he had no motive other than to discharge his duty under the circumstances as they
appeared to him and that he had an honest and reasonable belief that what he did was
necessary in the performance of his duty …then he is entitled to the relief he seeks. This

is so even though his belief was mistaken or his judgment poor.” Petition of McShane,
235 F. Supp. 262, 274 (D. Miss. 1964). 5
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cited McShane repeatedly in 1977, in the
case of a Federal agent who shot and killed a man fleeing an arrest scene. In finding the
agent immune from State prosecution, the Court opined that what constitutes necessary
and proper “must rest not only on the subjective belief of the officer but also on the
objective finding that his conduct may be said to be reasonable under the existing
circumstances.” Clifton v. Cox, 549 F.2d 722, 728 (9th Cir. 1977); accord Baucom, supra
at 1351 (finding a Federal agent immune from State prosecution for bribery instigated
pursuant to an undercover “sting” operation, and stressing reasonableness under the
existing circumstances).

In light of this precedent, we believe that a NOAA vessel performing a survey using
normal operating procedures is engaged in “necessary and proper” conduct.

Consequently, in the Cape Cod Bay situation, the Thomas Jefferson satisfies the Neagle
test while performing its Federally authorized surveying duties, and is immune from State
prosecution. The efforts by NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations
(OMAO) to work with local lobstermen to develop a surveying protocol that would
alleviate or minimize concerns of gear loss, and its ongoing activities implementing that
protocol, further demonstrates the reasonableness of OMAO’s actions. Collectively,
these actions militate against any finding that the Thomas Jefferson and its crew are
engaging in conduct outside of what is “necessary and proper.”
CONCLUSION
A State may not detain or prosecute a Federal vessel’s captain and crew for alleged
violations of State law which occurred pursuant to the captain/crew’s conduct of their
duty under Federal law, so long as these Federal employees did no more than was
necessary in fulfilling their duty under Federal law. As applied to the current case,
OMAO employees aboard the Thomas Jefferson should be immune from seizure and
prosecution for alleged violations of State law while conducting the Federally authorized
survey of the Cape Cod Bay area.

In McShane, a Federal marshal was charged under State law with ordering the use of tear gas on

both places for the remainder of the 2014 field season.

DIVER LEAST DEPTH GAUGE MODEL III

GENERAL
The MOD III Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG) consists of a Micro Gauge Corporation
precision absolute pressure sensor and a PTC Electronics Incorporated Model D2000
pressure readout assembly, with rechargeable batteries, housed in a specially constructed
rectangular water-tight enclosure. The following are used in conjunction with the
operation and care of the instrument: battery charger, underwater plug, special processing
software, Sea-Bird Electronics SEACAT CTD Profiler, and barograph. Neither the
profiler nor the barograph is provided with the instrument; rather they must be
resident on the ship.

PHYSICAL FEATURES
Figure 1 is a picture of the front of the enclosure of the MOD III DLDG. The face plate
on the enclosure is clear to allow the LED display to be read (in this case, 14.51 psia).

Figure 1

Figure 2 also shows the front of a MOD III DLDG. Shown to its left is an InSitu
MiniTroll instrument, a handheld absolute pressure gauge.

Figure 2

The rear face of the MOD III enclosure contains the bulkhead electrical connector and the
pressure port. There is a 7 cm vertical offset distance between the position of the
pressure port and the bottom of the instrument case. Note that this offset is applied as a
correction by program VELOCWIN in the computation of the least depth. Therefore, in
order to obtain a correct value for the least depth, the MOD III gauge should be placed on
top of the diver-determined least depth point and held level so that the LED readout is
upright (as shown in Figures 1 and 2).

THE GAUGE IS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY CHARGER WHEN
NOT BEING USED ON A DIVE OPERATION. This is to increase the reliability and
availability of the unit. A fully charged battery should give the gauge approximately 10
hours operating time. For the instrument to be returned from low voltage to its fully
operational condition, the battery must be on charge for 18 hours.

For the InSitu MiniTroll, the pressure port is 2.9 cm from the bottom tip of the probe.

The bottom tip is the end opposite the watertight screw cap covering the data port. The
2.9 cm offset is applied as a correction by program VELOCWIN in the computation of

the least depth. Therefore, for accurate results, the MiniTroll should be held upright with
the bottom tip of the wand placed on the user-determined least depth point.

SOFTWARE
The Diver submenu of program VELOCWIN provides two options to use in conjunction
with the Diver Least Depth Gauge:
(1) Least Depth Report
(2) Daily DQA – Diver Gauge.

The Least Depth Report option prompts the user for several inputs including the pressure
on-deck and at the user-determined least depth point. Using these two values, the
calibration data for the DLDG, and the data from a Sea-Bird SEACAT CTD cast taken in
the vicinity, VELOCWIN computes the least depth of the submerged object. The results
of this option are shown in Figure 3 which may be printed out to obtain a hard copy
record of the dive and the least depth result.

Figure 3

The Daily DQA option is a data quality assurance procedure for the DLDG. It prompts
the user for the on-deck DLDG pressure in psia and the barograph reading in mbars.

Using these values and the gauge’s calibration data, VELOCWIN determines if the
instrument is operating within acceptable bounds. The results are a running log file
(DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT) and a graphical display of the relationship between the
ship’s barograph and the DLDG. Figure 4 is an example of the graphical display.

Figure 4

The calibration file for the gauge has filename, SN.CAL, where SN is the serial number
of the gauge (example: 68332.CAL). The default location for this file is C:\VELOCITY,
the directory of program VELOCWIN. If it is stored elsewhere, VELOCWIN will
prompt the user for the location.

DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
The DAILY DQA option requires that the on-deck DLDG pressure be entered in psia to
two decimal places and the barograph reading be entered to the nearest millibar.

The LED readout is absolute pressure in units of pounds per square inch. This on-deck
reading should be in the region of 14.70 psia. The reading will rise and fall with the local
atmospheric pressure, along with variations in the distance below the water surface. The
nominal depth equivalent of a 0.01 psia change in pressure is 0.5 cm. If the gauge is
subjected to horizontal acceleration in a line between the pressure port and the LED
readout, there may be a small change in the pressure reading.

The DAILYDQA option should be run each day. It should also be run before and after
each day’s dive operation to provide a pre- and post-dive record. At the end of each field
season and any other time that the gauge is returned to a Marine Center, the running log
file, “\VELOCITY\DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT”, must be returned with the gauge.

The gauge uses a built-in, approximate calibration curve to derive the pressure values
shown on the LED readout. The more accurate calibration curve, by gauge serial
number, is employed by the VELOCWIN program to achieve high accuracy results. The
data quality assurance test might not indicate an exact one-to-one relationship with the
ship’s barograph, but the relationship should be reasonable and regular and fall within the
acceptance bounds shown in the DAILY DQA graphical display.

DIVE OPERATION
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the handle is attached to the gauge such that the unit must
be held in the diver’s right hand in order for the numerals in the LED readout to be
upright. The unit should be placed on top of the diver-determined least depth point and
held close to level. Below the water’s surface, a depth error, in centimeters, of
approximately 15*SIN(tilt angle) will result from non-level operation. When the unit is
at depth and fixed on the least depth point, the pressure readout will vary as a result of
any overhead surface waves. The peak to peak variation due to these waves may occur
over a period from 1 to 8 seconds. Therefore, it is necessary for the diver to observe the
LED readout for 10 seconds or more to improve the diver’s estimate of the mean
pressure.

On days when dive operations are to be conducted, the gauge will be disconnected from
the battery charger. The exposed electrical connector on the instrument must be capped
with the underwater connector which is provided. It is not necessary to disconnect the
battery charger from the ship’s A/C supply. There are three pins on the electrical
connector, one of which is larger than the others. The underwater plug has a flat spot
over the large pin. Care should be taken when inserting the charger cable plug or the
underwater blanking plug onto the instrument to be sure that the connector is correctly
orientated relative to the pins of the electrical connector on the rear of the enclosure.

Previous to each dive, the pressure reading on the instrument must be observed with the
unit out of the water and appropriately recorded. A diver will carry the unit on the dive
to locate and measure the least depth on a designated object. The accurate least depth is
determined via head pressure at the diver-designated least depth point, in conjunction

with the knowledge of the local vertical density profile. The head pressure is the
difference between the on-deck (pre-dive) pressure reading and the pressure observed by
the diver at depth. The density of the water column is obtained from the Sea-Bird
SEACAT CTD cast taken in the vicinity. Running the Least Depth Report option of
VELOCWIN computes the head pressure and converts it to the reported least depth.

Upon completion of a day’s dive operations, the Diver Least Depth Gauge must be
washed with fresh water and wiped dry. The underwater plug must be removed from the
rear of the gauge and stored in a safe place. Finally, the battery charger should be
connected to the gauge being careful of the connector orientation.

SUPPORTING DATA
The local density profile must be independently measured in the vicinity of the dive site
with a SEABIRD SBE-19 or SBE-19Plus SEACAT Profiler and processed via the
VELOCWIN program. The cast should be taken in accordance with the specific
SEACAT instructions, which are documented separately. However, IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT THE SEACAT SHOULD BE POWERED-ON AND HELD
ON-DECK FOR AT LEAST THREE MINUTES PREVIOUS TO LOWERING
THE SEACAT INTO THE WATER.

Complete instructions for taking a SEACAT cast are available from the VELOCWIN
Help submenu under Precast Setup
CALIBRATION
Each Diver Least Depth Gauge will require an annual calibration before deployment for
the field season. At the end of the field season, a post-deployment verification must also
be performed. Post-deployment verification and pre-deployment calibration may be
performed simultaneously. The gauge must be returned to the Marine Center for
forwarding to the manufacturer for calibration. Once calibration is accomplished, a
hardcopy calibration report will be provided for each gauge. A copy of the report must
be provided to HSTP/CSDL in order for an extended calibration curve to be generated (to
accommodate deep dives). HSTP provides the extended calibration curve as a digital file
named SN.CAL where SN is the DLDG serial number. The file is disseminated to all
field units.

CALIBRATION GUIDELINES
The gauge contains a 100 psia pressure transducer. Calibration between approximately
13 and 50 psia is critical for accurate least depth measurements. A data set of fourteen
points, with the first point being below ambient pressure, the next point at ambient
pressure, the next seven points at 1 psia increments above ambient pressure, and the
remaining points at 5 psia increments will insure sufficient accuracy. Replacing

exhausted batteries will not effect calibration; however, any circuit repairs will require
complete gauge calibration.

Calibration is performed by:
PTC Electronics Inc.

45 Whitney Road, Suite B9
Mahwah, NJ 07430
Attn: John C. Kicks

PROBLEMS
If the results of the DAILYDQA test fall outside the acceptance bounds, this fact should
be noted to the Marine Center and arrangements made for the gauge to be replaced and/or
repaired. In addition, inform the Marine Center if any other irregular performance of the
DLDG arouses suspicion.

NOAA FIELD UNITS HYPACK / HYSWEEP DEVICE SETUP SOP
HYPACK 2013 – Updated April 2013

*Page 1*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions are the standard basic setup guidelines for HYPACK and
HYSWEEP devices. Depending on the survey vessel equipment, there may be additional
configuration steps. There are two sets of device setups that need to be configured when using the
Hypack software suite. The first setup is in Hypack Hardware, which includes devices that
provide navigation, motion, heading, singlebeam bathymetry and AIS information. The second
setup is in Hysweep Hardware which includes navigation, motion, backscatter imagery and
multibeam bathymetry (See Diagram 1). It is also important to setup the Ethernet Realtime output
section in the POSView software to be compatible with this setup.

1. POS M/V Setup
* Items in this controller should only be changed by experienced users with the unit. If you
are new to POS you should only verify that the items addressed below are correct and then
you may start logging.

** Reminder: If you want to change anything in the logging control windows you must be
connected first.

1.1

Ethernet Realtime Output
The following message groups should be selected for Ethernet Realtime output in the
POS M/M POSView software: 3, 7, 10, 20 and 102. These are the only messages that
Hypack/Hysweep will read from the POS Ethernet feed. Any other messages can be
turned on, but will be ignored by Hypack/Hysweep.

2. Hypack Survey Setup
2.1

Starting a new Project
 In the main map viewer window: Select File &gt; Project Manager
 Select New Project – Name accordingly based on accepted naming convention.

All data will be stored in this project directory unless changed by the surveyor.

NOTE: Hypack will use the device configuration of the last loaded project.

2.2

Setting the Geodetic Parameters
* When creating a new project, it is very important to set the correct geodetic
parameters, including the UTZ zone and the ellipsoid for the survey area.

* Click on the “world” icon in the main toolbar to access the geodetic parameters.

* Select the appropriate grid (UTM North) and zone for the survey area
* Choose the GRS-1980 ellipsoid. This is the proper ellipsoid for the NAD-83
datum. See Image 2.

* Also confirm that the distance and depth units are set to meters.

2.3.3 AIS (ais.dll)
a. If the survey vessel is equipped with an AIS receiver, it can be interfaced with
Hypack to display vessel traffic information on the main map window,
b. Only the physical connection parameters need to be set. This is usually via a serial
connection. Example: COM#, 9600, 8, 1, None, None. The connection settings in
Hypack must match the receiver output settings.

2.3.4 Singlebeam Echosounder
a. All singlebeam echosounders are configured with a device in Hypack Hardware.

b. Many devices are available, one of the most common is the device driver for the
Odom MK and CV units used throughout the NOAA fleet (OdomCV_3.dll)
c. Odom units are setup via a UDP / Server network connection with a read port of
1600, write port of 1601. Refer to the Odom manual for details.

d. Under Setup, the channels are setup for “bathy” or “off”. Channels 1 and 2 are
used for dual frequency units. See Image 7.

e. The Function for the echosounder should be set to Depth, and the paper annotation
should be enabled.

Hypack Configuration – Clock Synchronization


After all the devices are setup and configured, Hypack needs to be set for clock
synchronization. This action will synch the PC clock to GPS time coming from the
POS M/V or other GPS device. If any device is integrated in Hypack that is not timed
externally, device messages will be stamped upon arrival in the Hypack program.



Normally the POS M/V device is used for clock synchronization. See Image 8.

Image 8 – Setting Clock Synch
2.5

Boat Configuration
 Check that the correct device (source) shows up next to each information type. This
should be correct by default.

 It is on this screen that you can change the tracking point of the boat. This will add
an offset to the navigational reference point so that the vessel’s transducer can be
steered over the survey line. This is important for real time coverage mapping on
vessels with a significant X-axis distance between the RP and the transducer. See
Image 9. (This offset is for display only)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Device Testing




Testing of devices should be conducted periodically to make sure all sensors are
communicating properly. Device testing is also commonly used as a troubleshooting
tool when communication errors arise. Devices should be tested individually and
together to determine any possible conflicts with other sensors.

The most important device to check in Hypack Hardware is the Applanix POS M/V.

Since this sensor provides navigation. Attitude and timing information, it is essential
that Hypack is receiving all data properly.

2.6.1

Click on the Test button in the POS M/V device to access the hardware test
screen.

a. Ensure that all of the categories are populated, changing and seem to be correct.

See image 10 below.

Image 10 – POS M/V device testing
b. IIN Mode – The following are a list of possible codes you may see in the “IIN”

section of the testing window:

RTCM DGPS is what should be populated when the system is working correctly
with DGPS corrector feed into the POS M/V unit. If DGPS is not available in the
survey area, RTCM may not be displayed. “No Solution” should never be
displayed.

INTRODUCTION

The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a bureau of the U.S.

Department of Commerce (DOC). The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in
the Earth’s environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our
Nation’s economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA’s vision in supporting this mission
is that of an informed society that uses a comprehensive understanding of the role of the oceans,
coasts, and atmosphere in the global ecosystem to make the best social and economic decisions.

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) of the National
Ocean Service (NOS) is an organizational element of NOAA. We operate and maintain a
network of 210 long-term water level measurement stations as part of the National Water Level
Observation Network (NWLON) around the coastal United States and the Great Lakes. The
NWLON supports the following four NOAA Mission Goals:
* * * * Healthy Oceans
Climate Adaptation and Mitigation
Weather Ready Nation
Resilient Coastal Communities and Economies

CO-OPS also installs and operates short-term water level stations in support of programs such as:
* * * * * * * * * Hydrographic and Photogrammetric Surveys
Marine Boundary Determinations
Treaty Regulation
Harbor Dredging
Climate Change
Long-Term Sea Level Rise
Habitat Restoration
Real Time Navigation
NOS VDatum Program

The data collected and the products derived from these water level stations are used to:




Ensure safe, efficient, and environmentally sound maritime commerce.

Provide data and products required by the National Weather Service to meet storm surge
flood and tsunami warning responsibilities.

Enhance navigation through a national network of Physical Oceanographic Real-Time
Systems (PORTS®) in major U.S. harbors.

PORTS® is a partnering effort based on the collaboration between NOS and local maritime
communities to identify and satisfy user needs for improving the safety and efficiency of
maritime commerce and coastal resource management through the integration of real-time
environmental observations, forecasts, and other geospatial information. PORTS® comes in
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 1 

different sizes and configurations, each designed to meet local user requirements. PORTS®
includes sensors, hardware, and associated communications systems which allow the centralized,
real-time data acquisition and dissemination of water levels, currents, and other oceanographic
and meteorological data. The modular design of each PORTS® installation allows the straight
forward integration of additional sensors to meet user requirements.

In carrying out our mission, CO-OPS performs the following:







Establishes the standards for the acquisition and processing of water level and current
data.

Collects and documents user requirements that serve as the foundation for all resulting
program activities.

Designs new and improved oceanographic observing systems; develops software to
improve data processing capabilities.

Maintains and operates oceanographic observing systems; performs operational data
analysis and quality control.

Produces and disseminates oceanographic products.

Archives the resulting oceanographic data.

These Standing Project Instructions provide the recurring requirements for installation,
operation, maintenance, and removal of water level stations in support of the NWLON,
PORTS®, Coastal Oceanographic Applications and Services of Tides and Lakes (COASTAL)
Program, hydrographic and photogrammetric survey operations, NOS VDatum and reimbursable
special projects. These stations provide critical data to support the following activities:








Ensure safe navigation
Determine flow rates to support International treaties
Determine tidal datums for the National Nautical Charting Program and the National
Shoreline Mapping Program
Determine the baseline from which marine boundaries are delineated
National Weather Service tsunami and storm surge warning programs
Coastal resource restoration and management
Long term sea level trend analyses.

The objective of these Standing Project Instructions is to ensure that all the deployed systems
and sensors are maintained in an effective and consistent manner for collecting continuous,
reliable, and defect-free data.

1.1 General Data and Reference Datum Requirements
The NOAA Nautical Chart Reference Datum for tidal waters is Mean Lower Low Water
(MLLW) based on the latest NOAA National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE) of 1983-2001. The
NOAA shoreline reference datums are MLLW and Mean High Water (MHW). See
http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/glossary2.pdf for descriptions of all tidal datums.
All tidal datum computations and water level reductions for shoreline surveys shall be referenced
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 2 

to these datums.

In cases where historical sites are re-occupied, every effort shall be made to collect the new data
series on the historical Station Datum (SD). In that case, data can be acquired relative to MLLW
for immediate application during the survey. If the historical datum cannot be recovered, an
arbitrary SD shall be assigned to the Primary Bench Mark (PBM) and the MLLW datum
calculated after 30 to 60 days of water level data are collected.

In non-tidal areas, including the Great Lakes, special low water datums have been defined and
are used as chart datum in these locations. For the Great Lakes, a unique Low Water Datum
(LWD) for each lake based on the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) is the
reference datum. In other non-tidal coastal areas, LWD is determined by subtracting 0.5 ft from
the Mean Water Level (MWL), as calculated from the water level data collected in these
locations.

Leveling and GPS connections to geodetic datums are made at each water level station, as
described in Section 3.6 Geodetic connections.

REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONNAISSANCE, INSTALLATION,
OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND REMOVAL OF WATER LEVEL
STATIONS

The following sections point to the references strategic to the reconnaissance, installation,
operation, maintenance, and removal of water level and/or meteorological stations.

The term Installer has been defined as a person or field party that performs any of the following
tasks: reconnaissance, installation, maintenance, repair, or removal of a water level station. The
installer could be CO-OPS personnel, NOAA ship personnel, Office of Coast Survey (OCS)
Navigational Response Teams (NRT), other NOAA personnel, or contractors.

2.1 Reconnaissance
The reconnaissance of water level and meteorological stations shall be performed in accordance
with Reference 13.

2.2 Water Level Sensor Specifications
The following sections provide the sensors and specifications that are used at CO-OPS water
level stations.

2.2.1

Primary Water Level Sensor

The primary sensor used at a CO-OPS water level station is one of the following:





Aquatrak™ self-calibrating air acoustic sensor
Paroscientific pressure sensors tied into a single or dual orifice gas purged bubbler
system
BEI Motion Systems absolute shaft angle encoder (SAE)
Design Analysis Waterlog microwave in a limited capacity

Currently, the Aquatrak™ sensor is used at the majority of tidal water level stations as the
primary water level sensor. At stations where the acoustic sensor cannot be used due to the
freezing of the water’s surface or the lack of a suitable support structure, a single or dual
Paroscientific intelligent pressure sensor(s) is incorporated into a gas purged bubbler system. In
the Great Lakes, a sump with a float driven absolute shaft angle encoder is used. A microwave
air gap sensor is used in selected PORTS® projects. Starting this year, a microwave sensor will
be used in a limited capacity at low wave energy locations.

The sensor type will be determined after the reconnaissance of the site is completed, the final
station design is performed, and CO-OPS has approved the site and the type of sensors. COOPS’ approval of the type of water level sensor is mandatory for a project.
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 5 

The sensor measurement range shall be greater than the expected range of water level and the
installation shall be designed to measure the full range of extreme water level such as highest
observed and lowest observed water level data (100 years, if available). The highest observed
may have an additional wave allowance value added as determined by ED.

Sensors are calibrated prior to deployment, and the calibration is checked following removal.

The calibration standard’s accuracy is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST).

For NWLON water level data, the water level sensor resolution is 1 mm or better. For
hydrographic and photogrammetry surveys the required water level sensor resolution is a
function of the tidal range of the area in which water level data is collected: when the tidal range
is less than or equal to 5 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 1 mm or better; when the
tidal range is between 5 m and 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 3 mm or better;
and when the tidal range is greater than 10 m, the required water level sensor resolution is 5 mm
or better.

Known error sources for each sensor are handled appropriately through ancillary measurements
and/or correction algorithms. Examples of such errors are water density variations for pressure
gauges, sound path air temperature differences for acoustic systems, and high frequency wave
action and high velocity currents for all sensor types. At a number of NWLON stations, dual
orifice gas purged orifices which are mounted a fixed vertical distance apart and connected to
two vented Paroscientific pressure transducers are used so that a density correction can be
estimated for each sample based on the pressure difference and gravity.

The orientation of the primary sensor shall be carefully documented in elevation (side) view
sketches and photographs, as required. Orientation of the protective well (or sump and intake in
the Great Lakes) relative to the wave or current modifiers such as nearby pilings, bulkheads, or
other structures in the water shall be photographed and documented. All features in the vicinity
of the protective well such as, pilings, other wells, decking, buildings (tide house), etc., which
might cause uneven sun/shading of the well and resulting non-uniformity of temperature inside
the well shall also be well photographed and documented.

The installer shall have all forms and figures submitted using metric units and referenced to the
SD as applicable. Other references (e.g. orifice zero or tide staff zero) shall also be shown on the
forms with reference to the SD.

2.2.2

Redundant Water Level Sensor

The redundant sensor used at a CO-OPS water level station is one of the following:



IMO, Druck, or KPSI pressure sensor tied into a single gas purged bubbler system
Waterlog relative shaft angle encoder (SAE)

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 6 

At tidal water level stations, the redundant water level bubbler orifices shall be secured
structurally independent of the primary water level sensors (i.e. on a separate piling, etc). At
Great Lakes stations, the Waterlog shaft angle encoder (SAE) shall be set to read the same as the
Electric Tape Gauge (ETG) and the primary SAE.

The cable lengths of all water level and ancillary sensors shall be noted in the E-Site Report, or
Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report to the nearest tenth of a meter (rounded up to the
nearest meter value). This will assist with the efficient replacement of cables should a failure
occur.

2.2.3

Tsunami Data Requirements

NWLON and other water level stations installed and supporting the NOAA Tsunami Program
shall have 1 minute averaged water level data available in addition to the 6 minute data. The 1
minute averaged data will be mainly coming from the primary sensor during the normal
operations. In addition, 15 second data from the redundant sensor shall also be made available in
the event of a tsunami, or as per the request of National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami
Warning Centers, and the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of NOAA’s Office of
Atmospheric Research (OAR).

The RAM pack and other storage devices may be appropriate for storing the 15 second data. The
sizes of the data files (minimum number of days data) for 6-minute water level data (ssp.log), 1
minute tsunami data (tsu1min.log), and system log data shall be collected according to
Engineering Bulletin 09-003 dated November 13, 2009. This Bulletin is available on the ROS
Wiki Page and can be made available for contractors on request, if applicable.

2.3 Data Collection Platform
The primary Data Collection Platform (DCP) shall acquire and store water level measurements
every 6 minutes. The water level measurements shall consist of an average of three minutes of
discrete water level samples with the period of the average centered about the six minute mark
(i.e. :00, :06, :12, etc.). In addition to the average measurement, the standard deviation of the
discrete water level samples and outliers which comprise the 6-minute measurements shall be
computed and stored. The 6-minute centered average water level data and the standard deviation
provide valuable data quality information regarding each measurement.

For NWLON stations, a redundant DCP shall also be installed so that in case of a failure of a
primary DCP or sensor, water level data from the redundant DCP or sensor can be retrieved. The
redundant DCP also shall acquire and store water level measurements every 6- minutes and the
water level measurements shall consist of an average of three minutes of discrete water level
samples with the period of the average centered about the six minute mark (i.e. :00, :06, :12, etc.).
The primary and redundant DCP, where applicable, shall have a capacity to store at least 30 days
of 6 minute water level data and meteorological sensor data, if applicable.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 7 

2.4 GOES Satellite Transmissions
The ability to monitor water level measurement system performance for near real-time quality
assurance is essential for operations. Water level data transmitted via satellite in NOS format is
retrieved and monitored by CO-OPS, and in the case of data gaps, sensor, or gauge problems,
corrective actions are taken immediately. At all sites where access to the GOES satellite is
available, and according to CO-OPS policy, the measurement system shall be equipped with a
GOES transmitter to telemeter the data to NOS. This section is applicable where water level
gauges are installed by CO-OPS or CO-OPS’ contractors for NWLON, Tsunami, COASTAL,
VDatum, Special projects, and NOAA in-house survey projects. This section is not applicable for
NOAA contract hydrographic or photogrammetric projects.

The data transmissions shall use the message format detailed in Reference 16. This format is
currently implemented in the Next Generation Water Level Measurement Systems (NGWLMS),
assuring compatibility with the CO-OPS Data Management System (DMS).

The NOS Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS) is a 24 x 7 data
monitoring operation. It monitors all water level measurement system data transmitted via GOES
to assure the gauges are operating properly. Data that is not transmitted by GOES but is
submitted to CO-OPS via diskette, CD-ROM, or such other electronic media, must also conform
to the format specified in the above document so that data can be loaded properly into DMS.

The clock accuracy of a satellite radio system shall be adjusted with a GPS clock for NWLON
gauges. For a tide gauge that does not have a GPS clock, or that transmits hourly or three hourly,
the clock accuracy of a satellite radio system shall be within 5 seconds per month for short term
water level gauges so that adjacent satellite channel overlapping does not occur. Non-satellite
radio systems shall have a clock accuracy of better than one minute per month.

2.5 Data Transmission Initiation and Station Database Configuration
Requirements
The CO-OPS’ Engineering Division (ED) Operational Engineering Team (OET) maintains the
GOES platform ID list for all water level stations in the NWLON. For new NWLON stations,
once the location, type of sensors, and DCP are selected, OET assigns the platform ID and
provides the satellite configuration data for the deployment.

For other types of water level stations, such as subordinate stations installed for NOAA in-house
hydrographic or photogrammetric surveys, or meteorological (met) only stations, OET also
assigns platform IDs, as appropriate. This section pertains to water level stations installed by
NOAA ships, CO-OPS, or CO-OPS IDIQ contractors. This section is not applicable for contract
hydrographic and photogrammetry stations installed by OCS and NGS survey contractors.

OET will provide station numbers and platform ID assignments for equipment setup and testing
when the location, which consists of a local name, body of water, and latitude and longitude, of
the station is reported to OET. OET can be reached by telephone at 301-713-2897, fax: 301-713Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 8 

4465 or 301-713-4435, or e-mail address at nos.coops.oetteam@noaa.gov. Requests for GOES
platform IDs shall be submitted to OET at least 15 days before throughput testing to allow
sufficient time to receive radio frequency assignments. Refer to Reference 32 for procedures on
requesting a platform ID.

Critical Information required
for water level station database
configuration at CO-OPS
Database Management
System (DMS):
(1) Station Number and Name
(2) Installation Date
(3) Latitude/longitude
(4) Platform ID, transmit time,
channel
(5) Serial numbers of all DCPs,
and sensors.

(6) Level abstract
(7) Sensor offset C1 (SNS) and
Datum Offset C2 (DAT) as
entered in the DCP for acoustic
sensor; and orifice offset(s) for
pressure sensors.

Prior to the installation of a station and initiation of GOES
data transmissions from the field, critical information that
is needed for database configuration shall be emailed or
faxed to OET. See the figure at left for the critical
information required for station database configuration in
the CO-OPS DMS. Test transmissions monitored by the
installer during the field unit installation may be
conducted outside this requirement.

This station information must be configured in DMS for data to be accepted in DMS. Whenever
possible, within 24 hours after reporting the above basic information and before the complete
inspection package is submitted, the draft E-Site Report (or Xpert Site Report or Tide Station
Report) shall be forwarded to OET. This is called the one-day draft E-Site Report submission
requirement and its purpose is to:
1) Standardize the requirements for all of CO-OPS’ field efforts;
2) Provide feedback by OET to the Installer while at the site, so that critical information is
verified; and
3) Insure that timely corrective actions and required maintenance actions as described in the
station specific Project Instructions can be accomplished by the Installer while at the site.

Generally, OET will respond back to the Installer or provide feedback within 24 hours or earlier
during normal business hours during the work week. This requirement applies to all types of
water level stations and all types of sensors for every type of maintenance - installation, regular
scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance and removal of a water level station, where COOPS is expected to receive and/or process the data.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 9 

CO-OPS has developed a web-based electronic site report (E-Site Report) that interacts with
DMS. Refer to Reference 27 and 28 for the User’s Guide and the SOP for using the E-Site
report.

The effective starting date of all operational sensor data series is the date and time when the data
is first received after the DMS configuration. It is the responsibility of the installer to ensure that
the required documentation is provided to OET prior to the date when the operational sensor data
are needed.

For the installation of the primary sensor, a leveling connection shall be made between the
Primary Bench Mark (PBM) and the sensor zero for the purpose of determining the sensor zero
height with respect to the SD. For the acoustic sensor, the sensor zero is the Aquatrak™ Leveling
Point (AQLP), which is the top edge of the collar on which the Aquatrak sensor rests. On the
ETG, the sensor zero is the ETG reading reference mark, also known as the ZETG, Zero of
Electric Tape Gauge. The Paroscientific pressure sensor zero is the vertex of the V-notch in the
side of the orifice, or the bottom of the top parallel plate. To make a leveling connection to this
sensor zero, a rod stop called the orifice staff stop - that can be leveled as part of the leveling run
- is installed at a point above the sensor zero and a calibrated steel tape measurement is made
between the sensor zero and the orifice staff stop. Using the height obtained for sensor zero with
respect to the SD, the datum offset (also known as Coefficient C2 or DAT), or the orifice offset
shall be calculated.

The field crew shall then submit the E-Site report, Xpert site report, or Tide Station report via
email or fax. Include a copy of the level abstract (and water level transfer form for Great Lakes
stations) to OET in addition to a phone call to OET so that sensor parameters can be properly
setup in DMS prior to the beginning of the accepted data collection.

The Installer shall contact OET (contact information is provided above at the beginning of the
section) and CORMS at telephone 301-713-2540, fax 301-713-4392, or e-mail corms@noaa.gov
a)
b)
c)
d)

Before performing any maintenance at a station
After the maintenance is completed
When a station is installed
When a station is removed.

The above procedure must be followed. If this procedure is not followed in timely fashion prior
to beginning of data transmission, data losses may occur. When the station sensors are properly
configured in DMS, the data is accessible through the CO-OPS’ web site at
http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.

Changes to the satellite platform ID, or the DCP telephone number, shall be reported to OET and
the supporting Field Operations Division (FOD) office immediately via telephone, email, or fax.

The Installer/tester shall follow the appropriate throughput testing requirements as described in
Reference 24.

2.6 Station Installation
The installation of water level station DCPs and sensors shall be accomplished according to
Reference 1, Reference 2, and the manufacturer’s instructions, as applicable. Nearly all of the
NWLON stations have the Sutron Xpert System (Xpert DCP and Xpert Dark as redundant DCP)
installed as of February 2011.

All new station installations, excepting short-term hydro/photo stations, shall undergo an
engineering design review in accordance with Section 3 of the ROS. FOD and NWLON O&M
contractor engineering design packages for station upgrades and installations shall be reviewed
and approved by the CO-OPS Field Engineering Review Subcommittee before any work actually
begins on the site. The installer shall obtain all required permits and permissions using CO-OPS
approved agreement templates for the installation of the water level sensor(s), DCPs, bench
marks, and utilities, as required and provide copies of signed agreements, permits, and
permissions to ED and the supporting FOD office as part of the design review process. A
complete reconnaissance report and station design heights shall also be submitted. The installer
shall be responsible for security and/or protective measures, as required, for protecting the
government furnished equipment and facility while installing, maintaining or removing a water
level station.

The water level station and its various components (tide house, Data Collection Platform, all
sensors, meteorological tower, bench marks, and pertinent access facilities such as railings, steps,
etc., as appropriate), when designed or installed by contractors, shall be installed and maintained
as prescribed by manufacturers installation manuals, appropriate local building codes, or as
specified by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), if applicable. The
water level station and all installed components shall be structurally sound for its intended
application, secure, and safe to use for NOS, local partners, and general public, as appropriate.
The installer must provide CO-OPS with the GPS position, as noted below in Section 2.9, of all
tide gauges and sensors installed before data collection begins, including those that were not
specified in the Statement of Work. In cases where gauge location(s) needs to be different than
that specified in the Statement of Work, installer shall consult with CO-OPS prior to the
installation.

structure, equipment, and bench marks) shall be taken and submitted. GPS photos shall be taken
according to Reference 6.

A minimum of four photos for each bench mark shall be taken: close-up of the disk face; chest or
waist level view of disk and setting; and horizontal views of the location of the bench mark from
two different (perpendicular) cardinal directions. Photos shall also be taken of station
components such as protective wells, staffs, houses, shelters, met towers, DCPs, sensors, etc.

One general location photo shall be taken showing the water level station in relationship to its
supporting structure and the local body of water. All digital photographs shall be submitted in
JPEG format. All digital station photo files should be named such that the name of the file will
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 11 

indicate the station number and the type of photo taken. For example, the acoustic sensor photo
for DCP1 at Los Angeles shall be named as 94106601 sensor A1.jpg.

The station components and bench mark photographs are required when a new station is
installed. The bench mark photographs shall be updated whenever any changes are noticed, such
as damaged bench mark disk, or changes to settings, etc, or as requested in the station specific
requirements.

All digital station bench mark photo files should be named such that the name of the file will
indicate the station number, dash, PID number (if available), dash, stamping or designation,
dash, photo type, dash, date, dot.jpg. For a new mark, the PID is not applicable as it is
unavailable. A close-up photo showing the face and stamping of the bench mark is photo type 1,
an eye level photo showing the bench mark and its setting is photo type 2, and a horizontal view
of the bench mark showing nearby landmarks is photo type 3. For photo type 3 include the
cardinal direction (N, NE, S, SE, etc) that the camera is pointing. If more than one type of photo
is taken for a given view, then re-name them as 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, etc. If a PID is
available, then use the designation instead of the stamping for the naming of the file. Use a
maximum of 30 alpha numeric characters to the left of the dot. If you are exceeding 30 alpha
numeric characters in the name, then truncate the stamping or designation so that the maximum
number of characters in the name are 30 (including spaces and hyphens). For example, the bench
mark E close-up photo for the Seattle water level station should be named as 94471307130E1990-1-20090101.jpg.
Sample file names for photo files:
Disk face photo of a new bench mark without a 9414290-4290A2008-1-20090101.jpg
PID
Eye level view photo of an existing bench
9410660-DY2512-BM N-2-20090101.jpg
mark with a PID
North direction photo of an existing bench
9447130-7130E1990-3N-20090101.jpg
mark without a PID
In addition, place a caption on each photograph, indicating the stamping or designation of the
mark, the PID, the photo type with cardinal direction, and the date of photograph taken. The
Windesc program for electronic leveling has a function to assist with the photo caption.

The above naming convention for the bench mark photo files shall be applicable for all of COOPS’ work and OCS hydrographic surveys. For NGS Shoreline mapping projects, contractors
shall follow the NGS specifications for file naming of bench mark photos.

NGS Coastal Mapping Surveys require a slightly different file naming convention as described
in Attachment R of the NGS Specs which is located at
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ContractingOpportunities/SOW_Main_Text_V13B_new.pdf . All
photos collected for NGS Coastal Mapping Surveys for both contract and in-house projects shall
be named according to NGS convention.

A completed water level measurement station installation consists of the following:
e) The installation of the water level measurement system (water level sensor(s), primary
and redundant DCP as appropriate, satellite transmitter, ancillary sensors if applicable,
other equipment as necessary and its supporting structure, and a staff (if required), as
specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract
documents.

f) The recovery and/or installation of the required minimum number of bench marks and a
level connection between the bench marks, Primary Bench Mark (PBM), and the water
level sensor(s), or tide staff as appropriate. The minimum number of bench marks or
specific marks to be leveled will be specified in the Annual Station Specific
Requirements, contract documents, or as specified in Reference 3 (See section 3.3 Levels
for additional leveling requirements).

g) The collection of GPS observations, a minimum four hour session, on one bench mark,
and submission of the data through OPUS DB for publishing.

h) Validation by CO-OPS of complete data transmissions, and proper data ingestion into
DMS, as evidenced by the data display on the CO-OPS website.

i) The preparation of all documentation and data and submission to CO-OPS (ED and
supporting FOD field office) in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for
timelines, documentation, and points of contacts).

The installer shall follow the appropriate sections of the SOP-06-001 as referenced in the
Reference 24.

2.7 Station Maintenance Requirements
Water level station standard annual maintenance shall be accomplished in accordance with the
Appendix F of Reference 1, and the most recent version of the AI checklist, or as instructed by
the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), or by the Task Manager (TM). A PDF file or
digitally scanned copy of the completed AI checklist shall be submitted for each station annual
inspection. The specific maintenance requirements for each water level station will be specified
in the Annual Station Specific Requirements for individual task orders for contracts.

CO-OPS shall monitor the near-real time water level gauge data daily for indications of sensor
malfunction or failure, and for degraded or invalid data, when the data is disseminated via GOES
telemetry using the NOS satellite message format. This includes data from CO-OPS NWLON
stations, and stations supporting hydrographic and photogrammetric surveys where CO-OPS or
CO-OPS contractors, Navigational Response Teams (NRT), or NOAA Ships install the
subordinate water level gauges. CO-OPS shall not monitor the subordinate stations installed for
NOAA contract hydrographic/photogrammetric survey projects by NOAA contractors.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 13 

This monitoring can be performed by accessing the CO-OPS web page
(http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). The data over the web are typically available for review
within one to four hours after the configuration of the DCP and sensors in DMS during the
normal business hours, after the installations of the DCPs and sensors in the field, and once data
is reviewed and dissemination is turned on by CORMS.

During annual maintenance visits to a station that has an acoustic sensor, the Aquatrak™ sensor
and matching cal tube shall be replaced. For stations where wind sensors are installed, wind
sensor nose cones shall be replaced during the annual maintenance. The Ultrasonic wind sensor
leads (if in question) shall be cleaned with a contact cleaner with a zero residue base. All
applicable sensor serial numbers (inside the tide or gauge house) shall be verified by the installer
(recorded by one person and confirmed by a second person in the field party). Safety of
personnel is of utmost importance and safety gear as necessary shall be used while climbing the
towers, etc, when required. Most of the serial numbers of the DCP boards and sensors are
generally recorded and verified during the installation, and only when equipment is replaced
during the maintenance, then the re-verification of the serial numbers is required.

Necessary repairs or alterations to the stations and equipment shall be made and documented on
the approved E-Site Report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report.

Repairs or alterations required by the Standing Project Instructions or the Annual Station
Specific Requirements, but not completed, shall be documented, along with the reasons for the
incompletion, on the approved E-Site Report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station Report. Each
field party crew chief shall provide a draft E-Site report, Xpert Site Report, or Tide Station
Report wherever possible, within one day of completion of maintenance and leveling operations
to OET.

The report(s) shall be completed by the installer before leaving each station; and reviewed by the
field team leader or contractor supervisor after completion of the maintenance visit but prior to
submission. The reviewed station package shall then be submitted to ED and the supporting FOD
field office within 1 month after the completion of the maintenance, or as specified in the
contract documents.

A minimum of 30 days of 6 minute water level data and 15 days of 1 minute tsunami water level
data shall be downloaded during each maintenance trip for NWLON stations and the data shall
be forwarded to OET as described in Section 4.2.2 Documentation Requirements. Engineering
Bulletin # 07-007 “Downloading (Exporting) Data from the Xpert Log Files using Xterm”
provides information regarding how to download the data from Xpert DCP.

Sizes of the Xpert Log Files (ssp.log, tsu1min.log, and System.log) shall be configured according
to the Engineering Bulletin 09-003 “Update to Xpert Log File Sizes”.

Approved primer and anti-fouling paint shall be used on all new protective wells and all
protective fiberglass/PVC components that will be in water, excluding the acoustic sensor
calibration/sounding tube.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 14 

For dual orifice pressure sensor configurations, the vertical stability and elevation to the leveling
points from each orifice shall be verified, including the distance between the two orifices. To do
so measure the elevation of each orifice to the staff-stop using a steel tape graduated in
millimeters. Two independent readings shall be taken and they should not vary more than 3 mm,
then report the average of the two readings. If the two readings vary more than 3 mm, then take
additional readings until two readings are obtained within 3 mm. The mounting assembly for the
two orifices shall be checked for structural integrity and the orifices shall be cleaned of
biofouling.

When first arriving at a station to perform annual maintenance, check and record the voltage for
each battery on all DCP units. Then remove AC power to both the Primary and Redundant
systems allowing them to run totally on battery power. After the units have had approximately an
hour of transmit loads on the Xpert DCP and at least 2 hours for the 9000 DCP, recheck the
voltage. If the battery voltage has dropped significantly (i.e. below 11.7 volts), replace it. Also
write the date of installation with permanent marker on each battery, and record this date on the
site report. Check all marine grade batteries to ensure that adequate water is in each cell. Use
only distilled water for replacement.

A new battery shall be replaced every four years during the maintenance trip for the NWLON
stations, where practical, or make arrangements to replace it at another time. The condition of a
newly installed battery shall be checked using the procedure described in the above paragraph
during the 2nd or 3rd year maintenance trip, and if the battery condition passes the test described
above then replace the battery during the 4th year after the installation. Of course, if a battery
does not pass the condition test as described above, then it shall be replaced immediately during
that trip and the date of replacement shall be duly noted on the approved E-Site Report (or Xpert
Site Report or Tide Station Report, if applicable).

All repairs, adjustments, replacements, cleaning, or other actions potentially affecting sensor
output or collection of data shall be documented in writing using appropriate approved
maintenance forms (refer to Section 5 for requirements for deliverables for water level station
documentation and timelines) and retained as part of the water level data record. This
documentation shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: date and time
(GMT) of the beginning and the end of the maintenance activity; date and time of adjustments of
the sensors; changes in the configuration of the DCP - such as a new datum or sensor offset, or
setting the time; personnel conducting the work; parts or components replaced; component serial
numbers; tests performed and test results; etc.

Proper NOAA identification emblems with an emergency phone number 1 (800)367-6622 shall
be placed on all water level gauge house doors or shelters. Emblems which are unreadable
should be replaced.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 15 

A completed station visit for maintenance (scheduled or emergency) consists of the following:
a) The maintenance or repair of the water level measurement system (water level sensor(s),
primary and redundant DCP as appropriate, satellite transmitter, ancillary sensors if
applicable, other equipment as necessary and its supporting structure, and a staff if
applicable), and as specified here in the Standing Project Instructions, the Annual Station
Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents.

b) For scheduled maintenance, the recovery and/or installation of the required minimum
number of bench marks and a level connection between the bench marks, PBM, and the
water level sensor(s), or tide staff is required. The minimum number of bench marks or
specific marks to be leveled will be specified in the Annual Station Specific
Requirements, contract documents, or as specified in Reference 3 (See Section 3.3 Levels
for additional leveling requirements.)
For emergency maintenance, recovery of bench marks and levels are generally not
required, unless the maintenance is done which may affect the elevation of the AQLP, or
orifice(s) for pressure sensor(s), in which case leveling, to the PBM and at least 2 other
marks, is required.

Only for scheduled maintenance, GPS observations on one of the bench marks as
specified in the Annual Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract
documents, may be required.

c) CO-OPS verification of complete data transmission throughput following maintenance,
from station to DMS ingestion.

d) The preparation and submission of all documentation and data to ED and the supporting
FOD field office in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for timelines,
documentation, and points of contacts).

The maintenance party shall follow the appropriate sections of the SOP-06-001 as referenced in
the Reference 24.

2.7.1 Additional Requirements for NOAA Sentinels
NOAA Sentinels are water level observing stations which have been strengthened to deliver realtime storm tide data during severe coastal events. Elevated atop substantial single pile platforms,
these stations are specifically designed to withstand category four hurricanes. NOAA Sentinels
measure and disseminate real-time water level and meteorological observations. All of this
information helps coastal authorities prepare for, mitigate, and respond to storm tides generated
by severe coastal storms.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 16 

The following are the additional maintenance requirements for the NOAA Sentinel stations
currently installed in the Gulf of Mexico:
Every Year:


Examine the anode and the anode attachment points. Inspect the attachment points for
excess corrosion and inability to remove fasteners. Provide measurements of the smallest
cross sectional area of the anode. Provide underwater photos of the anode and close-ups
of any excessive anode shrinkage or attachment point corrosion.

Every 2 years:


Inspect all painted surfaces for rust. Document significant rust areas in the Excel or ESite station report and provide photos of the occurrences. The repair of significant rust
areas shall be added to the following year’s project instructions along with procedures for
coating repair.



Inspect all galvanized surfaces for rust. Document significant rust areas in the Excel or ESite station report and provide photos of the occurrences. Repair spot rust with a wire
brush and cold galvanizing.



Inspect all welds for rust and cracks. Provide photos and document excessive rust and
cracks.



Check all fasteners on the protective well clamps, including half moon clamps, adjustable
arms, and attachment to clamp brackets. Tighten if loose.



Check the fasteners holding the solar panel mount to the railing. Tighten if loose.



Check all fasteners holding the enclosure to the support stand and the stand to the deck
grating. Also check the bracketing system along the upper portion of the enclosure.

Tighten if loose.



Check all fasteners on the Rohn tower. Tighten if loose.



Examine the underside of the high platform. Inspect the high platform bridge bolts for
looseness and rust. Document and tighten any loose bolts.



Examine the galvanized conduit for rust and cracks. Check also for water in the conduit
entering the bottom of the enclosure.



Examine the solar panel and Rohn tower flexible conduits for cracks and loose
fitting/tubing connections.



Grease the davit and winch. Examine for corrosion.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 17 

Every 5 Years:

2.7.2

Replace the battery pack in the Aid to Navigation light
Additional Requirements for Great Lakes Stations



The shaft angle encoders shall be inspected to insure the offset pulleys are not binding.

Lift the float tape off of the offset pulley and free spin the unit. If any binding occurs,
replace the bearing in the center of the gear. In addition and while the float tape is off of
the encoder gear and pulley, spin the encoder shaft to represent both a 2 meter increase
and a 2 meter decrease in the readings from the present reading. Then match the reading
with the ETG reference and reset the tape back on the gear and pulley. After this process,
remember to check the tape at the float connection to ensure that it has not kinked. This
rotation procedure will ensure that the oil lubrication around the enclosed encoder
bearings remains fluid. NOTE: - This test should only be performed during the time
period that the DCP is not calculating the water level reading. This time period, for
computing the water level reading, is 90 seconds before and after the allotted 6 minute
interval. Also check to see that the float tape length has been installed such that the float
neither tops out nor the counterweight bottom out before reaching its extreme limitations.



The float shall be inspected for corrosion and leaks; replace as necessary.



When closing off the intake valve note how many turns it takes to close off the intake as
well as how many turns it takes to fully open it. This shall be reported in the remarks on
the inspection sheet and on a tag placed on the valve handle. Also note the difficulty in
turning the valve such that it can be predicted when the valve would become unusable
and need replacement.



A water level transfer (inside/outside check) shall be performed at each station and
documented on the Site Report. The inside/outside water level must agree to within 0.006
m. The best time to perform a transfer is in the early morning or late evening when the
water level is most calm. The above procedure must be followed and actions taken to
correct any discrepancies.



When diving at gauge sites measure and report the elevation of intake invert and valve
invert on IGLD 85, if not previously noted. NOTE: The invert elevation is the point
where the water level can no longer be measured accurately. If the intake has a gooseneck
at the end this measurement should be taken at the lowest point in the curve at the top of
the gooseneck, not the opening.



Install rubber flaps over all locks on gauge shelters for protection against the weather.

The locks shall be inspected and lubricated to enable easy access.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 18 



Check gauge houses inside, outside, and around the doorframe for openings in the mortar
and caulk as required. Submit a statement of work to FOD for any work recommended
for completion by a contractor.



Check gauge house structure, door, and frame for rust and paint chips. Scrape and paint
as necessary.

2.8 Ancillary Sensor Metadata
The meteorological sensor site selection and measurement guidelines are listed in Reference 12.

Specific metadata for ancillary sensors is required as detailed below. The installer shall make
note of this data in the remarks section of the Ancillary Sensor boxes on the approved Site
Report or E-Site report. Metadata documentation shall be completed during the annual
inspections, or emergency maintenance visits, as appropriate, for all stations with ancillary
sensors. A unique Temporary Bench Mark (TBM) may be selected at each station and all the
required measurements can be referenced to that TBM. The TBM must be connected via levels
to the PBM. Then ED will relate the sensor elevations to SD and other datums as appropriate.

Photos shall be taken of the supporting structure and all of the ancillary sensors installed. The
photos should include as many of the four cardinal compass directions as possible, with the file
name indicating the direction of the view, i.e. 87617241 Met tower looking south.jpg. Photos and
sensor elevations must be submitted by CO-OPS to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) in a
timely manner before NDBC will accept the met data into its quality control process. Annual
photos of the met mast and ancillary sensors are not required once the sensors have been
installed. Wind sensors shall be aligned according to Reference 11.

Ancillary Sensor

Sensor Elevation Reference Point

Air temperature

Center of the sensor above the station datum and above ground to the
nearest +/- 15 centimeter.

Water temperature

Center of the sensor above the station datum as derived from subtracting
the distance from the leveling point to the center of the sensor from the
C2 value, to the nearest centimeter.

Barometric pressure

Surface of the pressure port above MSL (see Barometer Calibration
Guidelines) to the nearest +/- 15 centimeter.

Wind
Speed/Direction/Gust

Center of the sensor above the station datum and above ground to the
nearest +/- 15 centimeter. Note any major physical obstructions in the
vicinity of the sensor.

Conductivity

Center of the loop above the station datum to the nearest centimeter.

Relative humidity

Center of the sensor above the station datum and above the pier/ground
surface to the nearest centimeter.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 19 

Air gap

Sensor zero above the station datum as determined from trigonometric
levels to the nearest centimeter.

2.9 Obtaining and Recording Positions of Stations, DCP, Sensors, and Bench
Marks Using a Hand-Held GPS Receiver
Latitude and longitude of the station, DCP, all sensors, and bench marks shall be recorded using
a hand-held GPS receiver and recorded as degrees, minutes, seconds, and tenth of seconds (e.g.

45 degrees, 34 minutes, 32.6 seconds). The positions of the primary and backup DCP and all
sensors that are installed in a tide house (gauge house) shall be recorded as that of a station. This
position will be obtained in front of the tide house (gauge house) at the center of the front
door/front wall of the tide house (gauge house). The front portion of the roof of the tide house
(gauge house) may also be used as applicable if the GPS satellites are blocked from the structure.
For a standalone DCP or met sensors that are 3 m (10 ft) or greater from the station, obtain
positions and report appropriately on the Site Report.

For barometers which are generally installed in the tide house, report the latitude and longitude
as that of the station, but report the elevation above station datum as obtained from the leveling.
For Aquatrak sensors or Paroscientific sensors that are installed 3 m (10 ft) or greater from the
station location, obtain the positions of the sensors at the center of the sensor. If the Aquatrak
sensor or Paroscientific sensor is installed inside a tide house (gauge house), then report the
latitude and longitude as that of the station, but report the elevation above station datum.

For bench marks, obtain positions using the hand-held GPS receiver by placing the receiver on
the (horizontal) bench mark. For bench marks that are installed vertically, obtain the position as
close to the mark as satellite coverage will allow.

Handheld GPS units come with either patch antennas or quadrifilar antennas. The proper method
for holding the GPS unit is vertically if the unit has a quadrifilar antenna, or horizontally if the
unit has a patch antenna. Holding the unit otherwise will degrade the reception of the satellite
signals and reduce the accuracy of the position obtained. The Garmin GPSmap 76S units used by
CO-OPS have quadrifilar antennas.

Take a digital photo of the GPS unit display for each location acquired. This will insure
verification of the latitude and longitude that is entered into the Excel and E-Site reports.

2.10 Gauge Removal
The installer shall remove a water level station, if required, and as specified in the Annual
Station Specific Requirements, or as specified in the contract documents. A complete removal of
the water level measurement station consists of the following:
a) Closing levels - a level connection between the PBM and all the bench marks in the local
leveling network at the station, the water level sensor(s), and/or staff, if applicable.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 20 

b) Removal of the water level measurement system and restoration of the premises,
assuming reasonable wear and tear. The property owner shall be notified prior to removal
and thanked for supporting our programs.

c) Generally, GPS observations on one bench mark are done during the installation for short
term stations. If GPS observations are not done during the installation phase, and GPS
observations are required, then GPS observations shall be done during the gauge removal
time. Generally, GPS observations are required only one time for short term stations. For
NWLON and long term stations, the frequency of the GPS observations is determined by
the rate of sea level change at the station and if the GPS observations are required for a
specific year, those will be listed in the station specific project instructions.

d) The preparation of all documentation and data and submission to CO-OPS (ED and
supporting FOD field office) in a timely fashion (refer to Section 4 for requirements for
timelines, documentation, and points of contacts).

e) Return of all government equipment to appropriate supporting CO-OPS’ FOD field
office(s) in timely fashion within 15 days of station removal.

BENCH MARKS AND LEVELS

3.1 Reference Documents
Bench marks and level operations shall be performed in accordance with Reference 3.

CO-OPS electronic/barcode level operations shall be performed in accordance with Reference 31
and the Leica Manual for the DNA03 level. Help files for the TOPCON and Trimble level
instruments can be found in the Windesc and Translev programs available from NGS.

Bench mark descriptions shall be written in accordance with Appendix E of Reference 4 for
bench marks that are connected using the electronic levels. Descriptions for Great Lakes bench
marks shall be written in accordance with the NGS Bluebook, Formats and Specifications of the
National Geodetic Survey Data Base http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/BlueBook/, since those
marks are not published by CO-OPS.

Bench mark descriptions shall be written in accordance with Reference 5 for bench marks that
are connected using the optical levels, where electronic levels are not used, or as specified in the
contract documents.

3.2 Bench Marks
Unless specified otherwise in the work order or contract documents, the total number of bench
marks in the leveling network shall be a minimum of ten marks for the NWLON stations and a
minimum of five marks for subordinate stations installed for hydrographic and photogrammetry
surveys, special projects, or contract projects for U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, unless
otherwise directed by ED.

Descriptions shall be checked by verifying distances with tape measurements in metric units,
verifying cited landmarks and using a compass to confirm directions.

The handheld GPS coordinates of each mark shall be entered in the description file for electronic
levels, or noted on the published bench mark sheet or equivalent (for optical levels). The latitude
and longitude fields of the bench mark shall be reported in the following format:
degrees/minutes/seconds and tenths of seconds. For example, 40 degrees, 45 minutes, 35.2
seconds.

New bench mark sketches shall use CO-OPS’ standard bench mark sketch title block, or
electronic equivalent. If a digital sketch is used, submit the digital file in JPG format with the
leveling files and photos. If AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT is used to generate the benchmark
sketch, both a JPG format and the AutoCAD DWG format shall be submitted. Submission of
updated bench mark sketches are required only when necessary to document newly established
marks or physical changes in the area.

CO-OPS has photos of nearly all bench mark disk faces, setting, and location shots of NWLON
and active subordinate station tidal bench marks. The station specific requirements shall note any
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 22 

additional photos needed to achieve a complete photo gallery of each mark.

If a bench mark is discovered disturbed or mutilated during the visit to a station, include it in the
level run to determine if it is holding its elevation relative to the PBM and report it to ED and the
supporting FOD field office. ED will make a decision and inform the installer via the next set of
Station Specific Requirements regarding the action that needs to be taken: destroying the mark, if
it is a NOS mark, or dropping the mark from the leveling network for other marks. If the PBM
has been disturbed, contact ED immediately for further direction.

Before installing a new mark, perform a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) radial search from the tide station
(DCP) location at NGS web site, http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datasheet.html to check if any NAVD
88 marks are available that are not part of the local leveling network. Inclusion in the local
leveling network of an existing mark(s) that has a NAVD88 elevation, if it is located within a 1.6
KM (1 mile) leveling distance of the station location, is desirable and shall be preferred over
installing a new mark. If the bench mark is replaced, then the stamping of the bench mark shall
have a new letter designation (assigned by ED) and present year so that the new stamping is
different from the original stamping of the mark, or the stamping of other marks in the local
leveling network.

Digital photographs of bench marks shall be taken as described in Section 2.7 Station
Installation.

3.3 Levels
All leveling shall be performed with electronic/barcode systems, to either Second Order, Class I
or Third Order standards, in accordance with National Geodetic Survey (NGS) standards for
geodetic leveling, and CO-OPS "User’s Guide for the Installation of Benchmarks and Leveling
Requirements for Water Level Recording Stations, NOAA/NOS October 1987”. Beginning in
calendar year 2010, all CO-OPS and contractor field crews are required to use the NGS Windesc
description and Translev leveling software. Refer to the “User's Guide for Electronic Levels with
Translev and Windesc, Updated September 2010”
If digital bar-code leveling systems are to be used, the model should have been previously
evaluated by the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee (FGCS). These systems include the
Leica NA3003, Leica DNA03, Topcon DL101C, Trimble DiNi 12, Zeiss DiNi 10, DiNi 11, DiNi
12 and DiNi 12T. Bench mark descriptions and leveling output must be in a NGS-supported
format to enable processing and adjustment of the levels by NGS. Station bench mark
descriptions and recovery notes shall be submitted in computer-readable form using WinDesc
software. The basic WinDesc usage instructions are built into the program. You simply go under
the HELP menu when you run WinDesc. Field book and field abstract software are required and
are dependent on the leveling equipment used for this project. Translev is a NGS program that
facilitates the process of editing, formatting and checking digital leveling observation data and
creates abstracts, bok files, and VERTOBS datasets for submission to the National Geodetic
Survey (NGS). WinDesc and Translev are the two programs currently being used by CO-OPS to

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 23 

submit leveling data to NGS. NGS training is available if needed. These NGS programs are
available online at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/pc_prod.shtml.

CO-OPS will provide appropriate training to contractors in the use of the Windesc and Translev
software for leveling operations,
Second-order Class I leveling connections shall be made from the primary water level sensor
(AQLP or pressure sensor orifice [staff stop], and in the Great Lakes the ETG RM and the Spike
RM) to a minimum of 5 bench marks on an annual basis, including the primary bench mark
(PBM). In the case of pressure sensors as primary sensors, the elevation of orifice zero to orifice
staff stop(s) shall be measured annually using a calibrated steel tape with millimeter graduations,
and elevation of the orifice staff stop(s) to PBM shall be determined using the conventional
leveling equipment.

As described in the “User’s Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling
Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987” Section 3.3, Page 18, the levels are
required and shall be performed for seven cases listed. Particular emphasis is placed on
performing the check levels as per the specific project requirements or no later than 6 months
after the establishment of a new water level station. This is required for declaring a newly
installed water level station operational.

All of the bench marks in the leveling scheme shall be leveled within a two year period. This
may be accomplished by leveling to the PBM and four marks one year, then to the PBM and the
remaining marks the next year. In some cases, it may be practical to level to all the marks the
second year to reach the furthest marks from the station. A level connection to CORS reference
marks shall also be made once every two years, if those marks are within 1.6 KM (1 mile)
leveling distance from the water level station. The installer shall be responsible for ensuring that
every mark in the station bench mark network is leveled once every two years.

The two or three meter barcode rods for second order levels shall be used whenever possible at
all stations. At stations where three/two meter level rods cannot be utilized due to airline size
restrictions, justification for use of the Third Order barcode rods and levels shall be documented
on the NGWLMS Site Report. For stations in AK, HI, and Pacific Island areas the Second order
class I leveling requirement is waived and the Third Order levels are acceptable.

The primary water level sensor (ETG in the Great Lakes) shall be connected to the station bench
marks by levels. The levels shall be run upon sensor installation, in conjunction with annual
maintenance levels, if obvious sensor movement is noticed during regular/emergency
maintenance, and upon sensor removal. The levels to the sensor(s) shall be spur runs from any
bench mark, it is not necessary to have the spur run directly from the PBM to the sensor(s). If the
leveling starts at the sensor then it is not considered a spur run.

At Great Lakes sites where a spike is unavailable for use in performing a water transfer, (see
section 3.1, standing project instructions for a description of procedures to perform water
transfers), the water level in the sump shall be compared to the water surface outside the sump by
differential leveling and the use of the water level transfer program (h2o-tran). A difference
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 24 

exceeding 0.006 meters indicates a possible restriction in flow, which must be corrected. This
instruction must be recognized and initialed. Note: this procedure can best be accomplished in
early morning or late evening when the water is most likely to be calm.

When abstracting the raw level data using the electronic digital level system, the PBM shall
always be selected as the starting mark, and the AQLP, orifice staff stop, or ETG, as the case
may be, shall always be selected as the ending mark. If the original RAW file is edited before
processing, the original file (XXXXXXXo.RAW) shall be stored in a separate subdirectory
named “Original RAW”, and submitted with the edited RAW (XXXXXXX.RAW) file and other
level files.

While using the electronic levels, any changes made to the description file (XXXXXXX.DES)
require that the levels be reprocessed and submitted to ED. Dates of the DES file must be
chronologically consistent with the abstract ABS and other files generated. The date of the DES
file cannot be later than the date of the ABS file.

Newly installed barometric sensors shall be included in the level run as a spur. Barometric
pressure sensors shall be leveled, or their height otherwise determined in relationship to station
datum, during installation, or if the barometer is moved to a new location. Barometric sensors at
Great Lakes stations shall be leveled, or their height otherwise determined in relationship to
DYNAMIC/IGLD 85. Since small changes in elevation do not change the height correction, the
original leveling requirement to the barometer every five years is not needed. The elevation of
Mean Sea Level (MSL) above Station Datum in the header information for the specific annual
requirements for each station is based upon the 1983-01 tidal datum epoch. The Barometer C2
shall be computed to include both the calibration corrections and height corrections. The installer
shall ensure that the new elevation is also correct on the Site Report section for calculation of the
barometer C2. The barometer C2s shall be updated in the DCPs during the annual inspections.

The SSN for the barometric sensor shall be xx10 if it is included in the electronic leveling, where
xx is the part number. At Great Lakes stations, the “Barometer Installation Worksheet – Great
Lakes” shall be used to compute the Height of the Barometer above the ETG. Refer to Reference
9 for additional information.

3.3.1

Leveling to NOAA Sentinels and Elevated Platforms

Leveling connections on Sentinels and other elevated platforms require a combination of steeltaped height differences between the AQLP or a TBM at deck level (“deck” TBM) and a TBM
near ground level (“ground” TBM), and a standard level run between the “ground” TBM and
bench mark network.

To level from the AQLP to a TBM that can be included in the standard level run a TBM shall be
chosen that can be leveled to the existing bench mark network using the standard barcode rod.

This “ground” TBM shall be named and described per Reference 5 so that surveyors can level to
the exact same TBM in future level runs during the maintenance of the Sentinel or elevated
platform. The point where the taped measurement is made is critical in this description. This
TBM shall also be placed in a position where a taped measurement can be made from the TBM
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 25 

to the AQLP. If this is not possible, another TBM at the deck level of the Sentinel or elevated
platform shall be chosen, then named and described per Reference 5, again with care to include
the point of measurement in the description. This “deck” TBM shall be connected to the AQLP
using standard leveling procedures.

The steel taped distance from the “ground” TBM to the AQLP or “deck” level TBM shall be
performed on a windless day. A plumb bob shall be dropped from the AQLP or “deck” TBM to
insure that the steel tape is held as vertical as possible. A set of five readings each shall be made
by a minimum of two people for a total of ten readings. Each reading shall have the zero of the
steel tape positioned at the high point of the “ground” TBM and the elevation shall be read from
the tape at the AQLP or the high point of the “deck” TBM. The steel tape shall also be moved
away from the TBMs and repositioned for each reading. The ten readings shall be averaged to
acquire the height between the “ground” TBM and the AQLP or “deck” TBM.

The averaged steel tape height shall be entered into the DNA03 so that it is abstracted in to the
level run. This is done by manually entering a zero for the staff height on the “ground” TBM as
the Backsight, then entering the positive value of the averaged steel tape height for the
Foresight of the Forward Run. During the Backward Run, enter zero for the Backsight, then a
negative value of the averaged steel tape height for the Foresight. This will put the height of the
AQLP or “deck” TBM into the abstract when the levels are processed using Translev.

3.3.2 Leveling to Temporary Bench Marks (TBM)
Due to leveling to meteorological sensors and water level sensors connected to DCPs other than
DCP 1, the designation for TBMs shall be changed to include the full 8 digit station number:
XXX XXXXY, where XXX XXXX is the Station ID, and Y is the DCP number. For example: If
the barometer is installed on DCP 1 at 8410140 Eastport, the designation shall be TBM 841
01401 Barometer. If the barometer is installed on DCP 2, the designation shall be TBM 841
01402 Barometer. This format shall be used for all SENSOR TBMs
In addition, there have been several new water level TBMs added that are standardized in the
following table. Use the designations below to correctly identify the orifice and microwave water
level leveling point at a water level station. Due to the character limitations in WinDesc and
Translev, it may be also be necessary to assign an alias.

3.4 Datum Offsets and Accepted Orifice Offset
The leveling connection to an acoustic sensor shall be done at the AQLP. The AQLP is defined
as the top shoulder of the mounting plate collar on the calibration tube. In order to facilitate rod
holding, a prefabricated leveling fixture may be slipped over the sounding tube to rest on the
leveling point. The height of the leveling fixture, as inscribed on the fixture, shall be
compensated for in the leveling record (abstract). The level abstract shall show the elevation of
the leveling point only. A barcoded rule or stainless steel rule, with metric graduation (mm) and
the zero at the end of the rule, as appropriate, may be used in lieu of the leveling fixture by
holding the rule directly on the leveling point. In cases where the leveling point is too high for a
rod shot, the leveling fixture designed for a down shot shall be utilized and the readings recorded
to reflect the down shot. Use of other leveling fixtures and leveling techniques must be approved
in advance by ED.

The leveling connection to an ETG shall be done at the reading mark (RM). A barcoded rule (60
cm scale) or stainless steel rule, with metric graduation (mm) and the zero at the end of the rule,
as appropriate, may be used by holding the rule directly on the RM.

The AQLP elevation above station datum is defined as the Datum Offset and is computed by
algebraically adding the PBM elevation above SD to the acoustic sensor elevation above/below
the PBM. The Datum Offset is also referred to as Coefficient C2 for the Sutron 9000 DCP and as
DAT coefficient for the Sutron Xpert DCP.

The orifice zero elevation for the Paroscientific pressure sensor(s) above or below the SD is
defined as the Accepted Orifice Offset and is computed by algebraically adding the PBM
elevation above SD to the (sensor) orifice zero elevation above/below the PBM. The orifice zero
elevation is considered to be the point of the V on the brass orifice. For dual orifice systems the
orifice offsets are established for both “N1” and T1” pressure sensors.

At Great Lakes stations, the Dynamic Height of the ETG RM, plus or minus the Hydraulic
Corrector, at all lake stations, defines the IGLD 85 datum offset. In the Great Lakes Rivers and
Connecting Channels stations the “Dynamic Height = IGLD 85”, Hydraulic Correctors are not
applied. This datum offset is applied to the Primary Water Level C2 and should only be changed
by ED after reviewing the abstract and Water Level Transfer.

When using the electronic/barcode leveling system, all five decimal places shall be used to
determine the Datum Offset on the approved site report. After adding or subtracting the
difference between the leveling point and PBM, to the elevation of the PBM above the SD, round
off the five place value of the Datum Offset to four places. Rounding shall be done to the even
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 27 

number, for example: 1.53455 is rounded to 1.5346. A note shall be made to the effect that the
existing Datum Offset was retained in the DCP, or the new Datum Offset was entered with date
and GMT time it was entered. When new Datum Offset is entered into the DCP, additional
notification is required as listed below under Section 3.5 Movement. For stations that have the
Paroscientific pressure sensor(s) as primary sensor(s), the change of accepted orifice offsets shall
be documented on the Site Report with GMT date and time, and additional notification is
required as listed below under Section 3.5 Movement.

If optical leveling equipment is used, then all elevations shall be recorded to the tenth of a
millimeter level (e.g. 12.3457 m) on the leveling abstract.

After documenting the dynamic elevation for the ETG and SPIKE at Great Lakes stations, round
to four places and apply these elevations to the “Water Level Transfer” program. Then apply the
Hydraulic Corrector utilizing the sign, negative or positive in the program. This elevation is now
the hydraulically corrected reference elevation, Zero Electric Tape Gauge (ZETG) and is then
rounded to three places and entered in the DCP as Primary Water Level C2. C2 will not be
changed unless the elevation differs by greater than + 0.003 meters and only then after
notification and review by ED.

When setting up the encoder offset at Great Lakes stations, the C2 in the Xpert DCP (sensor 14,
coefficient 2 in the 9000 DCP) will need to be zeroed (0.000). The encoder gear will then be
turned to reference 6.000 M on the display. Then an ETG reading will be obtained and subtracted
from the 6.000 M reference. This difference, called the initial C2, is then stored in the Xpert
DCP (sensor 14 coefficient 2 in the 9000 DCP). All ETG/Display readings have to be within
0.003 m. If not, the set up procedure must be performed again. NOTE: This procedure can best
be accomplished in early morning or late evening when the water is most likely to be calm or by
closing off the valve.

The accepted PBM elevation above IGLD85 in meters shall be used as the starting elevation on
the level abstract at Great Lakes stations. This method results in all bench mark elevations
referenced directly to IGLD85.

At coastal sea level stations, the accepted PBM elevation above the SD in meters shall be used as
the starting elevation on the level abstract. This method results in all bench mark elevations
referenced directly to the SD. "Old" (before sensor swap) and "new" (after sensor swap) AQLP
connections, if required, shall be treated as spurs. Regardless of whether the acoustic sensor head
is swapped or not, the leveling shall be done only once after the sounding tube has been cleaned
and everything is put in place. For stations that have acoustic sensors installed, upon initial
inspection of the station, if the installer suspects a movement of the well or that of the AQLP,
then leveling shall be done twice, once before disturbing the well or sounding tube for cleaning
and then after repairing the well or cleaning the sounding tube. For stations that have pressure
sensor(s) installed, upon initial inspection of the station, if the installer suspects a movement of
the orifice(s), then leveling shall be done twice, once before disturbing the orifice(s) and then
after repositioning/securing of the orifice(s).

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 28 

3.5 Movement
The movement of an entity, such as (a) AQLP, (b) pressure orifice zero, or (c) bench mark is
defined as change in elevation of the entity in excess of 0.0060 m (0.020 foot) as obtained by
comparing the current difference in elevation of the entity with PBM, with the previous
difference in elevation of the entity with PBM. For acoustic sensors this difference shall be
compared to what is stored in the DCP and appropriate action shall be taken as described below.

For pressure sensor orifices this difference shall be compared with the accepted orifice offset as
listed on the site report (and stored in DMS) because the accepted orifice offset is not stored in
the DCP and appropriate action as described below shall be taken.

The movement shall be noted in the remarks box of the leveling section of the approved site
report. If the Datum Offset determined from the latest level run indicates a deviation exceeding
0.0060 meter from the value presently stored in the field unit, and the PBM has remained stable,
the new Datum Offset shall be entered into the field unit (no verification levels required) after
consultation with ED. If the PBM is determined to be unstable, and other bench mark differences
remain within the 0.0060 m allowable, the Datum Offset in the field unit shall not be changed.

The suspected movement of the PBM shall be specifically noted, as instructed above, for further
action by ED. At Great Lakes stations, if the Primary Water Level Coefficient 2 (C2) determined
from the latest levels indicates a deviation exceeding 0.003 meter from the value presently stored
in the field unit, and the PBM has remained stable, contact ED within 24 hours and provide the
leveling abstract and Water Level Transfer.

ED and the supporting FOD field office shall be notified by phone or email immediately when
the Datum Offset is changed in the DCP, or the accepted orifice offset has changed more than +/0.0060 m. An email (nos.coops.oetteam@noaa.gov), fax copy of the level abstract (fax 301-7134465), and a phone call (telephone 301-713-2897) if possible, must be received by ED and
supporting FOD field office within 24 hours of the change. Contact information for FOD field
offices are listed in Section 4.2.3.

3.6 Geodetic Connections
Water level datums are local vertical datums which may vary considerably within a geographical
area. A geodetic datum is a reference surface relative to which heights are determined. The North
American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) is the accepted vertical datum of the National
Spatial Reference System (NSRS) for the conterminous United States and Alaska and is
officially supported by NGS. The relationships of tidal datums to geodetic datums such as
NAVD 88 and to ellipsoid heights (above GRS 80 ellipsoid) support many hydrographic, coastal
mapping, and engineering applications including monitoring of sea level changes, the
deployment of GPS Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), and the NOS
Vertical Datum (VDatum) transformation tool.

Existing Geodetic Bench Marks (GBM) in the vicinity (up to 1.6 km (1 mile) leveling distance)
of a water level station (primary and subordinate) shall be searched for and recovered. If a mark
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 29 

is either not recovered or not used in the survey/project, a separate report shall be made using the
NGS on-line Mark Recovery Entry Form at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ngs-cgibin/recvy_entry_www.prl
The connection to geodetic datums involves the following three leveling ties:
1) NAVD88 Level Tie
2) NAD 83 GPS Tie
3) NAVD88 GPS Tie
An orthometric level connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie are required at each water level station
(primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located nearby (within 1.6 km (1 mi)
leveling distance of a water level station).

The required “NAVD 88 Level Tie” is described in this document and the required “NAD 83
GPS Tie” and “NAVD GPS Tie” are described in Reference 6.

3.6.1

NAVD 88 Level Tie

There are two parts for this requirement as described below in A and B.

(A) NAVD 88 Level Tie: At all water level stations, a valid level tie to at least two GBM is
required on each set of levels, where appropriate GBM marks are available within 1.6 KM (1 mi)
leveling distance of the station location. A GBM is defined as a bench mark that exists, is
useable, is available in the NGS database, has a Permanent ID (PID), and has a NAVD 88
elevation published on the datasheet. At many NWLON stations, the Primary Bench Mark
(PBM) is a GBM. At the majority of NWLON stations, there are two or more tidal bench marks
that are also GBM, thus increasing the chance that the geodetic level tie would be valid.

Make a Second-Order, Class 1 level tie to NAVD88 for all NWLON stations in the conterminous
United States and Caribbean Islands. A Third-Order tie is used for all NWLON stations in
Alaska, Hawaii, and Pacific Island areas.

At stations supporting hydrographic or shoreline mapping surveys, or other special projects, the
tie shall be consistent with the accuracy of the levels required for the project (e. g. 2nd order class
1 or 3rd order levels, etc.).

The Translev leveling program includes a check function that will tell the user if a two mark tie
to NAVD88 has been successful. Information on performing a valid level tie is also provided in
the Federal Geodetic Control Committee (FGCC) Standards and Specifications for Geodetic
Control Networks, listed at the following website:
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm#3.5
Also, Section 3.4 of “User’s Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling
Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987” provides the same information regarding
Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 30 

how to perform a valid level tie. The information in User’s Guide is easier to follow as it is
written in layman’s terms.

The Second-Order, Class 1 tie is a requirement for digital levels to be accepted into the NGS
database. Short level runs to the sensor, PBM, and two marks are excluded from this requirement
since they are usually meant to verify sensor stability only. Since a level connection to GBMs
with dynamic heights defines the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) datum
offset at each station in the Great Lakes, a valid connection to at least two GBMs (within a mile
of station location) is required at each site.

A note shall be made in the remarks of the leveling section of the Site Report that a valid tie was
achieved or not achieved. If a valid tie is not achieved, an explanation shall be provided and/or
recommendations made for making a valid tie in the future.

If a successful NAVD 88 level tie is performed, then NAVD 88 elevations for all the bench
marks in the local leveling network (10 for NWLON and 5 for subordinate stations) can be
determined for the NOS Vertical Datum transformation (VDatum) program.

If the water level station does not have two or more GBMs within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling
distance of the station location, then the NAVD 88 level tie requirement is waived.

(B) NAVD 88 Level connection: An orthometric level connection is required at each water level
station (primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located within 1.6 km (1 mi)
leveling distance of a water level station. If the water level station has two or more GBM within
1.6 km (1 mi) of radial distance of the station location, then perform a NAVD 88 Level Tie (as
described above in A) which fulfills the requirement for NAVD 88 level connection.

A successful NAVD 88 level connection to a GBM will help determine the approximate NAVD
88 elevations for the all the bench marks in the local leveling network (10 for NWLON and 5 for
subordinate stations) for the NOS VDatum program.

If there are no GBM within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of the station location, then the
requirement for NAVD 88 level connection requirement is waived.

3.6.2

Leveling at CORS

For any NGS Continuously Operating Reference System (CORS) reference bench mark that is
located within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance of a water level station DCP, a leveling
connection shall be made to the tidal bench marks in the water level station network every two
years.

Information about NGS CORS stations can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/.

As of 2010, there are a limited number of water level stations in this category, but NGS and COOPS are attempting to secure funding to establish additional co-located sites to support long-term
sea level trends monitoring.

Standing Project Instructions for Coastal and
Great Lakes Water Level Stations, Updated August 2011 

Page 31 

3.6.3

GPS Connections

An orthometric level connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie are required at each water level station
(primary and subordinate) which has at least one GBM located nearby (within 1.6 km (1 mi)
leveling distance of a water level station).

GPS connections involve the following two ties:
1) NAD 83 GPS Tie
2) NAVD88 GPS Tie
The required “NAD 83 GPS Tie” and “NAVD GPS Tie” are described in Reference 6.

USER’S GUIDE FOR GPS OBSERVATIONS

Introduction

This User’s Guide for Global Positioning System (GPS) Observations for the tidal and water
level station bench marks is prepared to support the Center for Operational Oceanographic
Products and Services (CO-OPS) GPS Implementation Plan. The field observation procedures
are developed in collaboration with the National Ocean Service (NOS), National Geodetic
Survey (NGS), and consist of slight modifications of NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS
NGS-58, Version 4.3, as described below, to obtain relative accuracy in connecting water level
stations to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and the North American Datum
of 1983 (NAD 83) coordinate systems. Modifications made to NOAA Technical Memorandum
NOS NGS-58 guidelines and requirements involve the length of the GPS observations required,
in this document. This Guide must be used in conjunction with NGS-58 for collecting the GPS
data at water level stations.

It is assumed that the field personnel are familiar with the basic operating principles of the GPS
equipment, the cable connections and the antenna/tripod setup procedures. A detailed discussion
of GPS processing software and processing procedures is outside the scope of this Guide. GPS
data collected by CO-OPS or CO-OPS’ contractors for the National Water Level Observation
Network (NWLON), for hydrographic and photogrammetric surveys either by NOS Office of
Coast Survey (OCS) and NGS field parties will be submitted to NGS for data processing –
“blue-booking” is a term used to describe this processing according to the Input Formats and
Specifications of the National Geodetic Survey Database, Appendix L – Guidelines for
Submitting GPS Relative Positioning Data.

All GPS data must be collected as per NGS specifications and as described later in this document
and processed first using NGS Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). All GPS data and
documentation shall be submitted to CO-OPS, which will then be forwarded to NGS, as per the
contracts, project instructions, statement of work, or as appropriate.

Equipment and Setup

High accuracy static differential GPS surveys require a geodetic quality, dual frequency, fullwavelength GPS receiver with a minimum of 10 channels for tracking GPS satellites. A choke
ring antenna is preferred; however, any geodetic quality ground plane antenna may be used.

More important than antenna type, i.e. choke ring or ground plane, is that the same antennas or
identical antennas models should be used during the entire observing sessions. If not, a
correction for the difference in antenna phase patterns (modeled phase patterns) must be applied.
This is extremely critical for obtaining precise vertical results. The antenna cable length between
the antenna and receiver should be kept to a minimum when possible; 10 meters is the typical
antenna cable length. If a longer antenna cable is required, the cable must be fabricated from
low loss coaxial cable (RG233 for up to 30 meters and RG214 over 30 meters).

A fixed height precise GPS antenna tripod is required for this type of a survey. This is a fixed
height, 2 meter pole with three adjustable legs, a bulls-eye bubble to plumb the antenna, and a
magnetic compass to align the antenna to North. These fixed height tripods reduce the chance of
introducing a Height of Instrument (HI) “blunder” during the post-processing of the data. There
are situations where it may be necessary to use the adjustable precise GPS antenna tripod, such
as when a bench mark is elevated above ground level or when using air transportation. The
center pole is adjustable on this tripod; therefore, if not fully extended to the 2 meter position,
the antenna height is measured with a steel tape (several times) and entered into the receiver and
onto the GPS Observation Log Sheet. In fact, even in the 2 meter position, it is recommended
that the adjustable tripod be measured to verify the length. There is a screw-on point at the
bottom of the center pole of both - the fixed and adjustable tripods - that must be inspected each
time the tripod is setup to ensure that the point is tight and not bent. The tripod must be stable
during observations; therefore, the tripod legs must be secured, preferably with sand bags.

Antenna set-up is critical to the success of the project. Plumbing bubbles on the antenna pole of
the fixed-height tripod must be shaded when plumbness is determined. Plumbing bubbles must
be shaded for at least 3 minutes before checking and/or re-plumbing.

The manufacturer, model, and complete serial numbers of all receivers and antennas must be
included for each occupation on each station/bench mark observation log sheet as shown in
Figure 3.

Geodetic connections and datums relationship

Water level datums are local vertical datums which may change considerably within a
geographical area. A geodetic datum is a reference surface relative to which heights are
determined. The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) is the accepted vertical
datum of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) for the conterminous United States and
Alaska and is officially supported by NGS. The relationship of tidal datums to NAVD 88 has
many hydrographic, coastal mapping and engineering applications including monitoring sea
level change and the deployment of GPS electronic chart display and information systems, etc.

Existing geodetic marks in the vicinity of a subordinate tidal station shall be searched for and
recovered. A search routine is available at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov. An orthometric level
connection and ellipsoidal GPS tie is required at a subordinate tide station which has at least one
geodetic bench mark located nearby as stated below for Sections “NAVD 88 Level Tie” and
“NAD 83 GPS Tie” requirements. NAVD 88 heights for published bench marks are given in
Helmert orthometric height units by NGS. The GPS ellipsoid network height accuracies are
classified as conforming to 2 cm or 5 cm standards accuracies (Refer to NOAA Technical
Memorandum NOS NGS-58). At the present time, GPS ellipsoid heights conforming to the 2
cm accuracy standards are required for all GPS survey projects.

A connection to the geodetic datums at a water level station enhances the value of the tidal data,
allowing comparison with other data sets. The geodetic network essentially serves as a global
reference datum to which all tidal datums can be referenced.

The connection to geodetic datums involves the following three ties:
(1) NAVD88 Level Tie
(2) NAD 83 GPS Tie
(3) NAVD88 GPS Tie
3.1.

Level Connections

3.1.1. NAVD88 Level Tie
At all water level stations, a valid level tie to at least two Geodetic Bench Marks (GBM) is
required on each set of levels, where appropriate marks are available within 1.6 KM (1 mi)
leveling distance of the station location. A GBM is defined as a bench mark that exists, is
useable, is available in the NGS database, has a Permanent ID (PID), and has a NAVD 88
elevation published on the datasheet. At many NWLON stations, the Primary Bench Mark
(PBM) is a GBM. At the majority of NWLON stations, there are two or more tidal bench marks
that are also GBM, thus increasing the chance that the geodetic level tie will be valid.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 3

Make a Second-Order, Class I tie for all NWLON stations in the conterminous United States and
Caribbean Islands. A Third-Order tie is used for all NWLON stations in Alaska, Hawaii, and
Pacific Island areas.

At stations supporting hydro or other special projects, the tie shall be consistent with the
accuracy of the levels required for the project.

Information on performing a valid level tie is provided in the Federal Geodetic Control
Committee (FGCC) Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks, listed at the
following website:
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm#3.5
Also, Section 3.4 of “User’s Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling
Requirements for Water Level Stations, October 1987” provides information regarding how to
perform a valid level tie.

The Second-Order, Class I tie is a requirement for digital levels to be accepted into the NGS
database. Short level runs to the sensor, PBM, and two marks are excluded from this
requirement since they are usually meant to verify sensor stability only. Since a level connection
to GBMs with dynamic heights defines the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85)
datum offset at each station in the Great Lakes, a valid connection to at least two GBMs is
required at each site.

A note shall be made in the remarks of the leveling section of the Site Report that a valid tie was
achieved or not achieved. If a valid tie is not achieved, an explanation shall be provided and/or
recommendations made for making a valid tie in the future.

If the NWLON water level station does not have two or more GBMs within 1.6 km (1 mi)
leveling distance of the station location, then the level tie requirement is waived.

3.1.2. Leveling at Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS)
For any NGS CORS reference bench mark that is located within 1.6 km (1 mi) leveling distance
of a water level station Data Collection Platform (DCP), a leveling connection shall be made to
the tidal bench marks in the water level station network every two years.

Information about NGS CORS can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/.

As of 2007, there are a limited number of water level stations in this category, but NGS and COOPS are attempting to secure funding to establish additional co-located sites to support longterm sea level trends monitoring.

GPS Connections

3.2.1. References
Static GPS observations shall be performed at water level stations in accordance with “NOAA
Technical Memorandum “NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid
Heights (Standards 2 cm and 5 cm), Version 4.3”. These guidelines are written for establishing
GPS derived ellipsoid height accuracy standards of 2 cm for all NWLON, PORTS®,
hydrographic/Photogrammetry survey projects, COASTAL projects, and special project
applications.

3.2.2. GPS Observations - Goals and Planning
Precise positioning of NWLON stations in a global geocentric reference framework is needed to
support NOS marine safe navigation and height modernization projects, in addition to
monitoring vertical crustal motions for absolute sea level and global climate change studies.

CO-OPS shall initiate a program of making periodic GPS observations at water level stations, as
resources permit. CO-OPS activities shall be coordinated with NGS activities for best use of
available resources.

GPS technology and procedures shall be implemented in the operational plan:
(1) To support the development of a seamless, geocentric reference system for the acquisition,
management, and archiving of NOS water level data. This will provide a national and global
digital database, which will comply with the minimum geo-spatial metadata standards of the
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and connect the NOS water level datums to the NGS
NSRS;
(2) To establish transformation functions between NOS chart datum Mean Lower Low Water
(MLLW) or Low Water Datum (LWD) in the Great Lakes, and the geocentric reference system
to support NOS 3-dimensional hydrographic surveys, the implementation of Electronic Chart
Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), and the NOS Vertical Datum transformation
(VDatum tool) and tidal datum models. Integration of GPS procedures will support the
development of tidally-controlled Digital Elevation Maps and Models for use in programs such
as marsh restoration.

(3) To support water level datum transfers by using GPS derived orthometric heights.

(4) To monitor crustal motions (horizontal and vertical) to support global climate change
investigations.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 5

The GPS surveys should be scheduled during routine annual maintenance trips to NWLON or
PORTS® stations and during the installation of secondary and tertiary water level stations to
support the survey projects, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects, COASTAL
project stations, tsunami stations, and special purpose surveys. CO-OPS shall continue to
coordinate the GPS occupation of water level network bench marks with NGS, USACE, and the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), as appropriate.

GPS-derived orthometric heights can be accurately determined and used for water level datum
transfers according to the following criteria: (a) use the established guidelines for 3-D precise
relative positioning to measure ellipsoid heights; (b) properly connect to several NAVD 88
bench marks; and (c) use the latest high-resolution modeled geoid heights for the area of interest.
In many remote locations, the use of GPS-derived orthometric heights for datum transfer will be
more efficient (timely) and more cost-effective than the use of conventional differential
surveying techniques and may, under certain circumstances, preclude the installation of
additional water level stations to establish a datum.

As specified in the Annual Project Instructions, Annual Station Specific Requirements, or in the
contract documents, installer shall be required to perform GPS observations at each water level
station at specified intervals over time, depending on the rate of sea level rise in that water area
of the coast.

As of March 2007, 20 NWLON stations have been identified where annual GPS observations are
required because of the sea level rise in those areas. These 20 NWLON stations – 8 in Alaska
and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico – will be identified in the annual Project Instructions. The rest of
the NWLON stations require GPS observations every five years. These guidelines will be
updated as GPS technology improves and the policy or regulations change in the future.

3.2.3. Static Surveys
Static GPS surveys shall be conducted on a minimum of one bench mark at each water level
station, according to the priority levels below. Generally, one mark at each station is designated
as the GPS mark and observations shall be made to that mark (as per the required GPS
observation frequency) unless otherwise specified in the Station Specific Requirements.

1. National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), PORTS®, and tsunami stations.

2. Long term operating secondary water level stations.

3. New tertiary survey, COASTAL stations, and special project stations.

4. Historical subordinate water level stations with an accepted MLLW value on the current
official tidal datum epoch
Static GPS surveys shall be conducted at water level stations periodically over time to establish a
history of relationship between the tidal or water level datums, and the ellipsoid.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 6

3.2.4. Criteria for Bench Mark Selection for GPS Observations
The GPS Water Level Station Bench Mark (GPSBM) shall be selected based on the following
criteria: (a) permanence or stability; (b) historic GPS use; (c) satellite visibility; and (d) safety
and convenience.

(a) Permanence or Stability of Bench Marks
NGS has defined the following monumentation quality codes, also called the stability codes, for
various bench mark settings.

Stability code A – monuments of the most reliable nature which may be expected to hold their
elevations very well; e.g. Class A rod marks, or marks installed on large boulders/rock outcrop.

Stability code B – monuments which probably hold their elevations well; e.g. Class B rod marks,
or marks installed on large concrete footings/foundations.

Stability code C – monuments which may hold their elevations but which are commonly subject
to surface ground movements; e.g. pavement or concrete monuments.

Stability code D – movements of questionable or unknown reliability.

The station bench mark selected for GPS observations shall be of stability code A or B. GPS
observations on the PBM are preferred if the PBM is either stability code A or B, and is suitable
for satellite observations. Stability code C and D bench marks shall not be used for GPS
observations, unless NGS has previously made GPS observations on those marks.

(b) Historic GPS Use
In many states, CO-OPS has provided NGS with lists of selected marks suitable for GPS
observations at water level stations, and NGS has completed observations on these marks. Some
tidal marks designated as Federal Base Network (FBN) or Cooperative Base Network (CBN)
marks may be of stability code C. Generally once a mark is selected for GPS observations,
future GPS observations shall be done on the same mark. If leveling reveals instability of the
mark over time, select another mark.

Priority shall be given to a GBM for GPS observations because the GBM already has a NSRS
height (NAVD 88). The GBM considered here is one of the 10 tidal or water level bench marks
at a NWLON water level station, or one of the 5 bench marks for survey or special projects.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 7

(c) Satellite Visibility
The most desirable bench mark for GPS observations should have 360 degrees clearance around
the mark at 10 degrees and greater above the horizon. Newly established marks shall be set in
locations that have these clearances, if at all possible. If a station does not have any marks
suitable for GPS observations, and it has been selected as needing GPS observations, a new 3-D
rod mark shall be established. This new mark shall be connected to the station bench mark
network through conventional geodetic leveling, and then GPS observations shall be made.

All existing station bench marks at operating stations shall be assessed for feasibility of GPS
observations, as time and resources permit. A note shall be made, either in the APP field of the
electronic leveling HA file or on a copy of the published bench mark sheet, stating the suitability
of GPS observations for each mark. The GPS visibility obstruction diagram as shown in Figure
5 under Section 6 GPS Project Documentation shall also be completed for each mark observed.

(d) Safety and Convenience
The location of the GPS bench mark should be safe, secure, and convenient. Bench mark
locations which allow unattended GPS data collection are desirable as the field crew can multitask at the same time as collecting the GPS data. The safety of the GPS equipment (vandalism
proof) should be considered in the mark selection process.

The bench mark selected for GPS observations should be located on public property rather than
on private property, as permissions from private owners may be required in the future to access
the bench mark and for collecting the GPS data. The distance from the station DCP should also
be convenient.

3.2.5. Planning, Position, and Photograph of the GPS Bench Mark
Regarding suitability of a mark for GPS observations, a review should be made first of the
historical bench mark information in the station files and level records, if access to that
information via database is available, or if the information is available. Stable marks from the
level records are identified and copies of the descriptions and sketches are made. Descriptions
and sketches are examined and marks are eliminated that have obvious obstructions, such as
vertical marks, marks set several meters from medium to large structures, etc. Do not eliminate
marks that are near poles, fences or about 20 meters from small structures at this time during the
preliminary planning. If no other mark is available or found suitable, and time does not permit
the installation of a new (GPS) mark, it may be necessary to use one of these marks. In selecting
a GPS mark, priority should be given to the NWLON PBM or an NGS, NSRS, mark with a First
or Second-Order NAVD 88 height on a NGS datasheet.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 8

If time permits, conduct a site reconnaissance survey prior to starting the GPS sessions, to select
the proper mark(s) to occupy with GPS. A site survey consists of preparing an obstruction
diagram for each useable mark using an inclinometer and placing a GPS unit (hand-held or
better) over the bench mark to determine how many satellites can be tracked at that location.

Determine the location of a suitable weather proof location, if any, for the GPS receiver.

Measure the distance from the mark to this location to determine the antenna cable length
required. Ideal marks should have approximately 360 degree unobstructed visibility above the
10 degree elevation mask. However, satellite geometry changes with time, so for 4-hour
tracking sessions some obstructions, particularly those to the north of the mark, may not degrade
the precision or accuracy of the final solution.

GPS (horizontal) positions (latitude and longitude) of each bench mark installed or recovered
shall be listed on the HA files for laser levels, if used, or on the bench mark descriptions sheet
for optical leveling, as applicable, at each subordinate water level station occupied for all
projects.

Digital photographs shall be taken of all station bench mark disks in accordance with Reference
5 - Attachment R, Requirements for Digital Photographs of Survey Control, NGS, July 2005”. A
minimum of three photos shall be taken: close-up of the disk face; waist or chest level view of
disk and setting; and horizontal view of location and direction of view. All digital station photo
files should be named such that the name of the file will indicate the station number and the type
of photo taken. For example, the bench mark A face photo for San Francisco water level station
shall be named as 94142901 BM A face photo .jpg.

A digital photo of the stamping of the bench mark occupied must be made as shown in Figure 7.

If a digital photo is not available, then a rubbing of the bench mark must be done as shown in
Figure 6. A digital photo of the stamping is preferred over rubbing of the mark.

3.2.6. Data Collection and setup
Set the epoch update or recording interval (REC INT) for 15-seconds, which should agree with
the recording interval of the reference stations (IGS or CORS) used to post-process the data. For
GPS sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second epoch intervals, starting at an
even minute. The elevation mask (ELEV MASK) is typically set for 10 degrees for static
surveys; low angle satellites can degrade the final solution. Set the minimum number of
satellites to four. For static surveying, setting the minimum number of satellites (MIN SV) is not
as critical as for kinematic surveying. However, if the number of satellites tracked drops below
four, it could be an indication of other problems, such as an antenna or antenna cable connection
problem, RF interference, or an obstruction from traffic (vehicle or vessel). The GPS signal
from the satellite is not very strong when entering the receiver, so anything that produces further
attenuation of the signal can cause the receiver to stop tracking satellites.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 9

Always collect a little bit of extra data if time and schedule permit, so that blunders or invalid
data, if any, can be removed during processing still leaving required minimum number of hours
of valid data for one GPS session.

It is recommended that after each session is complete, two independent downloads be done from
the GPS receiver to the laptop computer, so that if one downloaded file gets corrupted, the other
file may have good data. Since two downloads of the GPS observation file is a requirement, do
not make copy of the downloaded file twice to the laptop instead, as both the files will have the
same problem, if there exists a problem. Send both copies of digital GPS data so that one copy
of the data can be forwarded to NGS and other copy will be kept for record in CO-OPS’
Requirements and Development Division’s Operational Engineering Team (RDD/OET).

Data should be compressed and copied to a CD-ROM, diskette, and/or zip disk, as appropriate,
at the end of each GPS day for transporting data from the field to the office, or hotel as the case
may be, for processing. If data are logged to a PCMCIA card (flash card) in the receiver, consult
the receiver User Reference Guide about re-formatting the card prior to beginning observations.

Data should be collected during periods when the Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP) is less
than 6 for at least 90% of each 30-minute or longer GPS observations, if VDOP maps or data are
available for the site.

3.2.7. North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) GPS Tie
At each NWLON station, GPS observations shall be performed as listed in the Annual Project
Instructions, Annual Station Specific Requirements, and contract documents. The frequency of
repeated observations on the GPSSBM shall be determined based upon the rate of sea level rise
and general stability of bench marks in the local leveling network.

The NGS OPUS is now used extensively for quick and convenient processing of the GPS raw
data for a variety of applications. The position solution provided by OPUS is considered
preliminary data and is not retained by NGS. Further information on using OPUS is provided
later in this document.

The expected ellipsoid height accuracy for a 4 hour OPUS solution is 1.8 cm, (at the 67%
confidence level), and that is desirable, practical, and achievable with the requirements as
specified in reference #2, NOAA Technical Memorandum “NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for
Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid Heights (Standards 2 cm and 5 cm), Version 4.3.

The length of GPS observation sessions depends upon the length of time the field crew has
available for GPS observations, security of the equipment, number of satellites available at a site,
number of GPS receivers available for GPS observations, etc.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

For all water level stations, collect a minimum of 4 hours of GPS data on the GPSBM. Extra
care shall be taken to ensure that the antenna height is precisely recorded, and that the antenna
setup is stable. A continuous long session (at least 4 hours long but less than 24 hours) repeated
annually is preferred to two or more shorter sessions (of less than 4 hours each) repeated on the
same visit, providing better data for OPUS and more independent observations.

After the data collection session is complete, two independent downloads are required from the
GPS receiver to the laptop computer. If one downloaded file gets corrupted, the other file may
have good data. Do not make a copy of the downloaded file, as both the files will have the same
problem, if there is a problem. Follow the NGS guidelines for naming these files. Submit both
copies of the digital GPS data along with the necessary documentation as specified below.

3.2.8. GPS Data Processing Using OPUS
Field parties shall use OPUS for processing the raw GPS observations. OPUS provides an easily
accessible, rapid method for submitting GPS data and receiving an almost instantaneous solution
response from NGS via email.

The NGS OPUS web page can be obtained at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/.

The following information is found on the OPUS web page but is also presented here for
convenience of the reader.

OPUS allows users to submit their GPS data files to NGS, where the data will be processed to
determine a position using NGS computers and software. Each data file that is submitted will
be processed with respect to three CORS sites. The sites selected may not be the nearest to your
site but are selected by distance, number of observations, site stability, etc. The position for your
data will be reported back to you via email in both - ITRF and NAD 83 coordinates as well as
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), U. S. National Grid (USNG) and State Plane
Coordinates (SPC) northing and easting.

OPUS is completely automatic and requires only a minimal amount of information from the user,
such as:
(a) The email address where you want the results sent
(b) The data file that you want to process (which you may select using the browse
feature; raw or RINEX accepted)
(c) The antenna type used to collect this data file (selected from a list of calibrated GPS
antennas)
(d) The height of the Antenna Reference Point (ARP) above the monument or mark that
you are positioning.

Once this information is complete, you then click the Upload button to send your data to NGS.

User’s Guide for GPS Observations, Updated March 2007

Page 11

Your results will be emailed to you, usually within a few minutes. You may upload multiple
data files in a zip archive if you wish. However, be careful, the options that you choose will be
applied to all of the data files in that archive (i.e. the same antenna type, ARP height will be used
for all of the files in the zip file).

The following are some simple guidelines for analyzing the OPUS solutions.

(a) Make sure the antenna type and the ARP height are correct.

(b) Review the solution statistics:
(I) A good quality OPUS run should typically use 90% or more of your observations.

(II) OPUS should have fixed at least 80% of the ambiguities
(III) The overall RMS should seldom exceed 3 cm.

(IV) The maximum peak to peak errors should be less than 2 cm for horizontal and 4 cm
for vertical (This depends, of course, on the accuracy you are trying to achieve.)
NGS needs to receive orbit data from IGS in order to obtain a solution. If the data is submitted
too quickly (before NGS gets the orbit data from IGS), the submitter may need to re-submit the
data at a later time. For best results, submit the GPS data to OPUS at least 17 hours after the
first midnight (in Greenwich Mean Time) following the time when the observations were
recorded. Compare the resultant solution to the last previous solution made at the station, if
available, to ensure that you do not have a blunder in the antenna setup. This will be revealed by
a noticeable discrepancy in the ellipsoid height. Include a copy of the solution in the station
inspection documentation package submitted to RDD/OET, as well as to NGS GPS data sets.

3.2.9. OPUS DB Preliminary information
Pending NGS support, OPUS DB will be released by NGS in the near future. This advanced
version of OPUS will submit solutions directly to the NGS database for publication as part of
NSRS if all required documentation is provided by the submitter. Further guidance will be
provided once OPUS DB is released and this document will be updated as appropriate. Any data
sets submitted to OPUS will be subsequently re-submitted by RDD/OET to OPUS DB to ensure
the data is published by NGS, provided all the proper and required GPS data and documentation
(as listed below under data submission section) has been submitted to CO-OPS.

Height modernization guidelines are listed at the following url:

CO-OPS at the end of the project (see the time frames for submission of GPS data later in
Section 4.1) so that proper information can be forwarded to NGS for blue-booking purposes.

This documentation is important because most of the information is used to submit the GPS data
to NGS. In addition to the log, data must comply with the “Data Submission to NGS Section” of
NGS-58 (Reference 2) and the “Input Formats and Specifications of the National Geodetic
Survey (NGS) Data Base” (Reference 4) to become part of the NSRS.

GPS data collected by contractors or NOAA Ships for hydrographic survey support, or special
projects shall be processed by the parties, and final data product - Receiver Independent
Exchange Format (RINEX) data and appropriate forms - shall be submitted to CO-OPS which
will be forwarded to NGS, as per the contracts, project instructions, statement of work, or as
appropriate.

DATA REFORMATTING
Convert the raw GPS data to RINEX2 format with your manufacturer's software. The software
should require you to enter the raw data filename, the output filenames, your name, the
observer's name and agency, and the antenna type used.

The NGS-standard data filenames are as follows:
Raw GPS input files: aaaaddds.xxx
Where: aaaa = Alphanumeric 4-character station identifier,
ddd = Julian day of the year,
s = session, yy = year of observations,
and xxx is the receiver-dependent file extension (e.g., .DAT, .EPH, .ION, .MES, etc.)
RINEX2 navigation and observation files shall be named as follows.

RINEX2 Navigation File: aaaaddds.yyn
RINEX2 Observation File: aaaaddds.yyo
For example, RINEX2 filenames for navigation and observation from station BALD 2 on session

GUIDELINES FOR ESTABLISHING GPS-DERIVED ELLIPSOID HEIGHTS
[Standards: 2 cm and 5 cm]
Version 4.3
Preface:
The following guidelines were developed by the National Geodetic Survey
(NGS) for performing Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys that are
intended to achieve ellipsoid height network accuracies of 5 cm at the 95
percent confidence level, as well as ellipsoid height local accuracies of 2
cm and 5 cm, also at the 95 percent confidence level. See Appendix A for
information about local and relative accuracies. These guidelines were
developed in a partnership with Federal, state, and local government
agencies, academia, and private surveyors and are the result of processing
various test data sets and having extensive discussions with various GPS
users groups.

We are confident that these guidelines, if followed, will result in
achieving the intended accuracy. Additional tests may show that some of
these guidelines can be relaxed. These guidelines are intended for
establishing geometric vertical control networks.

These guidelines will be expanded in the future to include the
establishment of GPS-derived orthometric heights that approach these same
accuracies, 2 cm and 5 cm. The slight differences between the accuracies of
GPS-derived ellipsoid heights and GPS-derived orthometric heights will be
generally due to the accuracy of the geoid model and published orthometric
heights used to evaluate the differences between the three height systems,
i.e., ellipsoid, geoid, and orthometric heights.

Note: these guidelines assume that for the survey project area in question,
NGS has completed the establishment of a high accuracy reference network at
100-kilometer spacing or that a state-wide High Accuracy Reference Network
(HARN) has been established, i.e., there are A- or B-order stations
distributed throughout the state at an approximate spacing of 50 km or else
there are Federal HARN stations or GPS Continuously Operating Reference
Station (CORS) sites located within 75 km of the project area.

An effort should be made to connect to stations which were previously
determined using these guidelines (or equivalent).

Introduction:
Accurate connections to the control stations cited in the Observations
section on the next page must be made in the International Terrestrial
Reference Frame (ITRF) coordinate system. (See Appendix C for more
information on ITRF.) This is accomplished by simultaneous observations
between selected A-order (5 mm + 1:10,000,000 accuracy standards) stations
of the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) and/or NGS CORS or
NGS-approved CORS within about 75 km of the project. NGS-approved CORS are
those which NGS has positioned or approved with respect to the ITRF/NAD 83
coordinate systems. If there are none available, B-order (8 mm +
1:1,000,000 accuracy standards) stations within about 75 km of the project
may be substituted. However, it must be noted that the use of some of the
B-order stations may mean that the network accuracy of +/- 5 cm will not be
achieved.

These IGS stations and CORS sites are located throughout the United States.

The IGS stations or CORS sites located closest to the project must be used.

The following commands are used to access the NGS CORS system:

login: anonymous
Password: your complete e-mail address
The same files are accessible with Web browers (i.e., Mosaic, Netscape,
Internet Explorer). The NGS home page is at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov
"Information about A- and B-order stations is given on five sets of CD-ROMs
covering the United States." The particular CD-ROM that covers the project
area in question can be obtained by contacting NGS' Information Services
Branch, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, (301)
713-3242 (voice), (301) 713-4172 (Fax). A limited amount of this
information, i.e., the 100 closest stations of any type, can be retrieved
from the NGS world wide web site. The electronic bulletin board system
and/or web site usually contain new stations that have been added after the
CD-ROM was produced.

Analysis of the quality of project data shall be based on repeatability of
measurements, adjustment residuals, and analysis of loop misclosures.

Please be aware that repeatability and loop misclosures do not disclose all
problems.

Observations:
The following requirements are for both 2-centimeter and 5-centimeter
standards, unless otherwise stated.

1. Dual-frequency, full-wavelength GPS receivers are required for base
lines greater than 10 km and are the preferred type of GPS receiver for all
observations, regardless of base-line distance. Geodetic-quality antennas
with ground planes are required. Whenever possible, antennas used during a
project should be identical; otherwise corrections must be made for antenna
phase patterns. Different makes and models of antennas have different
antenna phase patterns. If antenna phase patterns are not accounted for,
mixing different antennas in a project can cause vertical discrepancies of
as much as 10 cm. Some manufacturers are including software packages which
correct for the use of different antennas. (It should be noted that choke
ring antennas help reduce the effect of multipath and are highly
recommended.)
The manufacturer, model, and complete serial numbers of all receivers and
antennas must be included on each station Session Observation Log.

2. The survey shall be referenced to at least three existing National
Spatial Reference System A- or B-order three-dimensional control stations
near the project area. The survey will also consist of at least three
primary base stations that are referenced to the three control stations and
interspersed throughout the project. The survey will also include secondary
base stations and local network stations to meet the spacing requirements
in item 5., below. Primary and secondary base stations can be newly
established stations in this project.

A sample project with observing scheme is depicted in figure 1 located at
the end of the section. A summary of the guidelines is provided in table 1
located at the end of the vector processing section. See Appendix A for
more information about control, base, and local network stations.

3. For control stations and primary base stations, receivers shall collect
data continuously and simultaneously for at least three, 5-hour sessions on
3 different days during the project.

4. Observation periods for stations other than control stations and primary
base stations are as follows:
a. For the 2-Centimeter Standard: Each base line (adjacent station
pair) must be occupied for a minimum of 30 minutes per session.

b. For the 5-Centimeter Standard: Observations between primary and
secondary base stations must be for a minimum of 30 minutes per session. While
there is no minimum observation time for local network stations, each base
line (adjacent station pair) must be occupied long enough in each
session to ensure that all integers are fixed and the RMS for the base
line solution does not exceed 1.5 cm.

5. The observing scheme is based on the GPS survey of marks spaced as
indicated below for 2- and 5-centimeter standards. Stations in the scheme

are noted as either control, primary base station, secondary base station,
or local network stations. (The observing scheme chosen for a sample
project is depicted in figure 1, page 7.)
For the 2-Centimeter Standard: Spacing between local network stations
cannot exceed 10 km; the average spacing must be less than or equal to 7
km. Spacing between primary base stations cannot exceed 40 km and spacing
between primary and secondary base stations cannot exceed 15 km.

For the 5-Centimeter Standard: Spacing between local network stations
cannot exceed 20 km; the average spacing must be less than or equal to 10
km. Spacing between primary base stations cannot exceed 50 km and spacing
between primary and secondary base stations cannot exceed 20 km. (Note that
secondary base stations may not be required in projects of small areal
extent. See Item 2. above.)
6. The observing scheme for all primary base
primary base station must be connected to at
station neighbor and nearest control station
procedures stated in item 3., above. Primary
traceable back to two control stations along

stations requires that each
least its nearest primary base
according to the observing
base stations must be
independent paths.

In addition to this requirement for primary base stations, the observing
scheme for all base stations (primary and secondary) requires that each
base station be connected with at least its two nearest primary or
secondary base station neighbors according to observing procedures stated
in item 4., above. For secondary base stations, one of these connections
must be to its nearest primary base station neighbor. Secondary base
stations must be traceable back to two primary base stations along
independent paths.

Local network stations must be traceable back to two base stations along
independent paths.

The observing scheme for all stations requires that all adjacent stations
(base lines) be observed at least twice on 2 different days and at two
different times of the day according to observing procedures shown in item
4. on the previous page. The purpose is to ensure different atmospheric
conditions (different days) and significantly different satellite geometry
(different times) for the two base line measurements.

Observations on the second day should be completed between 27 and 33 hours
after the completion of the first day's observations if the first day's
observations were begun prior to 12:00 noon. Or, the observations should be
completed between 15 and 21 hours after the completion of the first day's
observations if the first day's observations were begun after 12:00 noon.

This is necessary since the satellite constellation geometry repeats itself
every 12 hours.

Examples:

First-day observations
Begun during:
8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.

10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.

1:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.

3:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

Second-day observations
Completed anytime between:
11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.

2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.

4:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.

7:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.

(Note that the second day of observations does not need to follow
immediately after the first day. Satellite geometry moves ahead, or
precesses, 4 minutes per day. If the second observations are not performed
within 1 week of the first, this daily 4-minute change must be accounted
for when meeting the different satellite geometry requirement.)
7. Selection of primary and secondary base stations in order of
most-to-least- preferred are: 1. High Precision Geodetic Network
(HPGN)/HARN (either Federal Base Network (FBN) or Cooperative Base Network
(CBN) stations which have level ties to bench marks of A- or B-stability
quality during this project; 2. bench marks of A- or B-stability quality or
HPGN/HARN stations which were previously tied to bench marks of A- or
B-stability quality; 3. User Densification Network (UDN)stations which have
level ties made during this project; or 4. bench marks of C stability
quality. In areas of known or suspected subsidence or uplift, special
guidelines may need to be followed.

8. Data should be collected during periods when the Vertical Dilution of
Precision (VDOP) is less than 6 for at least 90 percent of each 30-minute,
or longer, observing period. For shorter observing periods, as in some
projects where the 5-centimeter standard is the goal, a VDOP greater than 6
should be avoided entirely. Travel between stations could be scheduled
during large VDOP periods.

9. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second epoch
intervals, starting at an even minute. For sessions less than 30 minutes,
collect data at 5-second intervals.

10. Track satellites down to at least a 10-degree elevation angle. (Note
that tracking below 15 degrees may be helpful during processing when
collecting data for less than 30 minutes.)
11. If possible, coordinate observations with local, existing CORS which
are collecting phase data with dual-frequency receivers.

12. Meteorological data must be collected at the control stations and
primary and secondary base stations. Weather data consist of wet- and
dry-bulb temperatures (or dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity) and
atmospheric pressure. For sessions greater than 2 hours, record weather
data at the beginning, middle, and end of each session. For sessions that
are less than 2 hours in length, but more than 30 minutes, record weather
data at the beginning and end of each session. For sessions that are less
than 30 minutes in length, collect data at the mid-point of the session.

Meteorological data shall also be collected immediately after an obvious
weather front passes during a session and also immediately before it
passes, if possible. Atmospheric pressure measurements must be made at
approximately the same height as the GPS antenna phase center. Record on
the observing log the time and where the weather data were gathered, and
any abnormal weather conditions.

(Note that even though all of these data may not used in the vector
processing, they may be helpful during the analysis of the results and in
future reprocessing with more robust software.)

Before taking weather observations, the meteorological instruments should
be allowed ample time (approximately 10 minutes) to stabilize to ambient
conditions. Observations of wet- and dry-bulb temperatures must be observed
and recorded to at least the nearest 1 degree Celsius. Barometric readings
must be observed and recorded to at least the nearest 1 millibar.

Meteorological data should be collected at or near the antenna phase
center. All equipment must be checked for proper calibration.

13. Antenna set-up is critical to the success of the project. Plumbing
bubbles on the antenna pole of the fixed-height tripod must be shaded when
plumbing is performed. Plumbing bubbles must be shaded for at least 3
minutes before checking and/or re-plumbing. The perpendicularity of the
poles must be checked at the beginning of the project and any other time
there is suspicion of a problem.

For the 2-Centimeter Standard: Fixed-height tripods are required for all
receivers.

For the 5-Centimeter Standard: Fixed-height tripods are preferred for all
receivers. When a fixed-height tripod is not used, the height of the
antenna must be carefully measured to prevent station set-up blunders.

Tribrachs used for these set-ups must be checked and adjusted when
necessary. Totally independent measurements of the antenna height above
mark in both metric units and English units must be made before and after
each session. Someone other than the observer must check the measurement
computations by carefully comparing measurements and then entering his/her
initials on the log.

14. A rubbing of the mark must be made at each occupation of a station.

When not feasible to make the required rubbing, a plan sketch of the mark
must be substituted, accurately recording all markings.

Vector Processing:
The following requirements are for both 2-centimeter and 5-centimeter
standards unless otherwise stated. A summary of the guidelines is listed in
table 1 at the end of this section.

1. Final vector processing and quality review of collected data shall be
accomplished using NGS' program OMNI or other interactive,
graphics-producing software which produces results equivalent to OMNI. The
vector between adjacent GPS-occupied stations shall be processed using the
multi-station processing technique which includes double-difference phase
corelations (or equivalent) with a selection of a reference station that
minimizes vector lengths.

2. Use precise ephemerides. NGS' precise ephemerides are available from the
U.S. Coast Guard Bulletin Board System or the NGS world wide web site. The
Coast Guard Bulletin Board System number is (703)313-5910 and the NGS web
site address is http://www.ngs.noaa.gov The USCG web site address is
http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/navcen.htm
3. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, process data using 30-second epoch
intervals. (Note that using a smaller epoch interval may improve ease of
data processing.) For sessions less than 30 minutes, process data using
5-second epoch intervals.

4. For sessions greater than 30 minutes, use only satellite data tracked
above the 15-degree elevation angle. For sessions less than 30 minutes, use
satellite data tracked above the 15-degree elevation angle; data collected
below the 15 degree elevation angle should only be used if required to
derive a successful solution.

5. Final processing shall consist of fixing all integers for each vector
for all sessions except to some control sites. For short base lines, under
10 km, the L1 fixed solution may be the best choice. For vectors greater
than 40 km to control sites, a session may consist of a set of partially or
completely fixed vectors and in the worst possible scenario may also
include float solutions where no integers could be fixed.

A model to account for tropospheric effects must be used. The project
report must state which model was used. Measured meterological data should
be used only when it has been determined that the instruments have been
properly calibrated and the measurements accurately represent the current
atmospheric conditions at the station. If standard meteorological data are
used instead of actual measured values, the processing software must
account for changes in standard default values due to the station's
location and height above the vertical datum. For base lines greater than
15 kilometers or with "large" height differences, a relative tropospheric
scale parameter should be solved for, along with the base line vector
components.

6. The quality of collected data shall be determined from the
double-difference residual plots and RMS values. Final coordinates and
their quality assessment shall be determined by using least-squares
adjustment software and by analysis of repeated vectors and free-adjustment
residuals and loop misclosures (most loops consisting of repeated vectors).

7. RMS values for each computed base line (adjacent station pairs) must not
exceed 1.5 cm.

8. Reobservation criteria:
For the 2-Centimeter Standard: For local network requirements, must
reobserve any base line (adjacent station pair) where the difference in
ellipsoid height between the repeat observations exceeds 2.0 cm. For
station pairs involving control stations, must reobserve any control
station base line where the ellipsoid height difference between the repeat
observations exceeds 5.0 cm.

For the 5-Centimeter Standard: Must reobserve any base line (adjacent
station pair) or control station pair where the ellipsoid height difference
between the repeat observations exceeds 5.0 cm.

When reobserving base lines that exceed tolerance values, the new
observation must agree with an old base line which was observed using the
criteria in number 6. of the Observations section above, i.e., the two base
line measurements must contain significantly different satellite geometry.

Notes for Table of Summary of Guidelines:
1 Analyses have indicated that when following all guidelines in this
document, 30 minutes of observations over base lines that are typically
less than 10 kilometers will meet the standards. For base lines greater
than 10 km, but less than 15 km, 1 hour sessions should meet the standards.

For observing sessions greater than 30 minutes, collect data at 15-second
epoch interval. For sessions less than 30 minutes, collect data at 5-second
epoch interval. Track satellites down to at least 10-degree elevation
cut-off.

2 Base lines must be reobserved on different days with significantly
different satellite geometry.

3 The observing scheme requires that all adjacent stations have base lines
observed at least twice on two different days with significantly different
geometry.

4 If base line is greater than 40 kilometers, a partially fixed or float
solution is permitted.

Data Submission to NGS:
1. The project accession number is of the form GPS-xxx. (The project
accession number will be assigned by NGS when draft project plans are
submitted to NGS for evaluation prior to the start of the project.)
2. A project report and the data elements listed in Appendix L of "Input
Formats and Specifications of the NGS Data Base" must be transmitted to
NGS. Quality checks for conformance to NGS format standards shall be
performed using software programs COMPGB and OBSDES.

3. Latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid heights, as well as X, Y, and Z
coordinates shall be provided in both NAD 83 and ITRF coordinate systems.

See Appendix C for more information on transformation parameters and
related information.

Appendix A. -- Definitions
Accuracy
Local Accuracy - The local accuracy of a control point is a value expressed
in cm that represents the uncertainty in the coordinates of the control
point relative to the coordinates of the other directly connected, adjacent
control points at the 95 percent confidence level. The reported local
accuracy is an approximate average of the individual local accuracy values
between this control point and other observed control points used to
establish the coordinates of the control point.

Network Accuracy - The network accuracy of a control point is a value
expressed in cm that represents the uncertainty in the coordinates of the
control point with respect to the geodetic datum at the 95 percent
confidence level. For National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) network
accuracy classification, the datum is considered to be best supported by
NGS. By this definition, the local and network accuracy values at CORS
sites are considered to be infinitesimal, i.e., to approach zero.

Stations
Base Stations
Primary - Stations evenly distributed that surround the local network.

These stations relate the local network to NSRS to the 5-cm, or better,
standard through simultaneous observations with control stations. They
can be newly established stations and be part of the local network.

Secondary - Stations evenly distributed throughout the local network that
ensure that the local network does not contain a significant medium
wavelength (20-30 km) ellipsoid height error through simultaneous observations
with primary base stations. These stations may be newly established stations
and are part of the local network. They are located between Primary Base
Stations.

Control Stations
A- or B-order three-dimensional stations that surround the project area in
at least three different quadrants. These stations relate the local network
to the National Spatial Reference System through simultaneous observations
with primary base stations. They must be referenced to NSRS and they
provide the network accuracy. They may be newly established stations in the
survey project if A- or B-order specifications and procedures are used to
establish them. These procedures are not covered in this document, please
contact NGS for additional information.

Local Network Stations
These stations include all other stations that are not base (primary or
secondary) or control stations. They are part of the local network. They
provide the local accuracy standard through simultaneous observations between
adjacent stations.

APPENDIX C.--ITRF TO NAD 83 TRANSFORMATION PARAMETERS
Introduction
The International Earth Rotation Service Terrestrial Reference Frame
(ITRF) has become an important coordinate system for users of Global
Positioning System (GPS) technology. Both GPS and ITRF are global,
geocentric coordinate systems. The ITRF coordinate system supports GPS
orbit computations and provides a basis for more precise GPS data
reduction computations. Also, for many applications it is necessary to
use a coordinate system such as ITRF to account for the motions of the
Earth's crust. Published ITRF solutions provide not only coordinate
values at a particular epoch in time, but station velocities as well.

Thus, up-to-date ITRF station coordinate values can be computed for
future epochs in time after the original solution.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), on the other hand, has the
advantage of being fixed and stable relative to the North American
tectonic plate. Additionally, NAD 83 has been officially adopted by
the Federal government as the coordinate system for mapping and
charting in the Unites States. Therefore, the relationship of ITRF to
regional or continental datums like NAD 83 is of utmost importance to
GPS users.

The following background information on NAD 83 should help
understanding the differences, systematic and otherwise, between ITRF
and NAD 83.

NAD 83 Datum Definition
The NAD 83 adjustment combined terrestrial data (distances, azimuths,
and direction observations) with space-based data, such as 3-D
positions derived from satellite Doppler observations and 3-D
inter-station vectors obtained from Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI).

Along with these data, and equally important, was a set of implied
constraints that defined the scale and orientation of NAD 83. Also
included in the NAD 83 adjustment was a set of global parameters that
allowed the implied constraints to have complete influence. An example
would be that of a distance observation which has implied scale, but
if a global scale parameter is included in its observation equation,
it allows the scale to be determined elsewhere. Table 1 shows the
global parameters for the NAD 83 adjustment:

The above table shows that the 3-D positions derived from Doppler
observations defined the geocentricity, scale, and the major part of
the orientation of the NAD 83 datum.

The VLBI vectors are very important for several reasons. To begin
with, the VLBI vectors are extremely precise. These vectors span the
continent and are found to be internally consistent at the 2-3 cm
level. Second, the VLBI stations and data are an integral part of the
ITRF solutions and thus provide a link between NAD 83 and ITRF. Third,
although the VLBI vectors were not used to help define the NAD 83
scale and orientation, the adjusted values for global parameters
associated with the VLBI vectors tell how they were changed. This
provides a quantitative measure of the systematic difference between
NAD 83 and coordinate systems based on VLBI.

NAD 83 Upgrade Surveys
In 1988, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) began to upgrade the NAD
83 coordinates by performing high accuracy reference network (HARN)
GPS surveys. This is being done on a state-by-state basis. The
strategy for determining the control for these upgrades follows. First
consider the following (X, Y, Z) transformation, designated equation
1:
Xn = Tx + (1 + S)Xi + RzYi - RyZi
Yn = Ty - RzXi + (1 + S)Yi + RxZi
Zn = Tz + RyXi - RxYi + (1 + S)Zi
This equation defines a seven-parameter transformation from ITRF to
NAD 83, where (Xi, Yi, Zi) denote geocentric cartesian coordinates in
ITRF and (Xn, Yn, Zn) denote geocentric cartesian coordinates in NAD
83.

In order to establish control stations for the new HARN GPS surveys,
NGS completed the following:
1. NGS used a set of 12 VLBI stations located in North America to
determine a seven-parameter transformation (equation 1) from
ITRF89 (epoch 1988.0) to NAD 83 (see table 3).

2. NGS decided to accept the scale of ITRF89 as being closer to the
true value.

3. The derived transformation parameters, translations, and
rotations, but NOT scale, were applied to the complete set of
ITRF89 positions to get NAD 83 values with corrected scale. A
comparison with the original NAD 83 coordinates showed a change
in ellipsoid height of 0.6 meters, which was caused by scale
differences.

item 3) above.

Apparent in Table 3 is the similarity of the values for the rotations
and scale with those in Table 2. This indicates that the coordinate
system of the original VLBI vectors is very similar to ITRF.

Computations of GPS Data in ITRF
Several other solutions of ITRF have been computed by the
International Earth Rotation Service since the publication of ITRF89.

As more and more data have been collected and included in the ITRF
solutions, the resulting coordinates and velocities have increased in
accuracy. Confidence in ITRF has grown to the point that most geodetic
organizations throughout the world now use ITRF as a basis for GPS
orbit computations.

An important concept for the GPS user community to understand is that
since GPS precise orbits are referred to ITRF, fixed orbit solutions
of GPS produce vectors that are oriented in the ITRF coordinate
system. However, most of the user community is working in NAD 83. The
systematic differences between ITRF and NAD 83 must be accounted for,
if high accuracy is to be maintained.

Since we are dealing with inter-station vector components, instead of
positional coordinates, we need not worry about X, Y, Z shifts. Also,
recall that the scale of NAD 83 was corrected when the high accuracy
GPS survey began. But the X, Y, Z rotations between ITRF and NAD 83
must be accounted for. NGS adjustment software ADJUST does just that.

ADJUST accepts GPS vectors expressed in ITRF as well as other
coordinate systems as input, then, internal to the program, applies
the X, Y, Z rotations to convert to NAD 83.

Table 4 describes transformation parameters between NAD 83 and some
more recent solutions of ITRF.

Additional Attribution Guidance
Additional Pydro Flags
The following is a list of additional flags in Pydro to support data processing and analysis:

Pydro Flag

Submitted

Office QC

Rejected

Significant

Tgt
Exported

Description
Denotes that items flagged as Primary+Chart+DTON have been
exported from Pydro to a DTON report for submission to MCD.

Once marked Submitted, these items will not be re-exported during
creation of subsequent DTON reports unless the “Submitted” flag is
manually cleared prior to generating the report.

Denotes that AHB/PHB examination and verification have been
completed for an item. The Pydro PSS for a completed survey to be
submitted to HSD or otherwise archived shall not contain any Primary
items that are not flagged Office QC. This is a Processing Branch tool
only.

Identifies any item that the hydrographer does not want included in
the survey. Any pertinent information explaining why the feature has
been rejected should be included under the Remarks tab of the
Editor’s Notebook. Rejecting an imagery feature in Pydro will flag
the corresponding SIPS contact as rejected, but will not delete the
contact. Rejecting a bathymetry feature in Pydro will clear the
Outstanding flag in HIPS, but will not reject the corresponding
sounding data.

Identifies features which meet the NOAA significant contact height
criteria set forth in the HSSD (see section 5.2.2 and 6.2.1), or some
other priority condition determined by the field unit, and warrant
further investigation and/or development. If applied to a Primary
feature, the Significant flag will automatically be applied to all
correlating Secondary features.

Denotes that an item was flagged Investigate and has been exported
to MapInfo MIF/MID and HYPACK TGT format, typically for some
subsequent investigation procedure. This flag will be set automatically
when “Export Investigation Items” function in Pydro is performed.

Once marked Tgt Exported, these items will not be re- exported
unless the Tgt Exported flag is manually cleared prior to performing
the export.

In Bathy

Designated

Outstanding

Forces a feature’s least depth to be explicitly included in the PSS
database of shoal-biased binned line (PVDL) data for plotting in
Pydro, MapInfo (via Hydro_MI’s “Draw PSS” function), or otherwise
exported from Pydro. A sounding must first be classified as a
bathymetric feature to be designated In Bathy. Once flagged In Bathy,
that depth will take priority over other PVDL bathymetry data and
other feature depths in the PSS during over-plot removal.

This flag is used to force a feature’s least depth to be explicitly
included in the two PSS bathymetry databases (as applicable) for
display/analysis in Pydro (both over-plot removed Depths and
ZSurfaces), plotting in MapInfo (via Hydro_MI’s “Draw Pydro Data”
Post Survey tool), or otherwise exported from Pydro: (i) HIPS
BASE/Weighted Grid data and (ii) shoal-biased binned line (PVDL)
data. During bathymetry layer over-plot removal (aka “excessing”) in
Pydro, feature depths may suppress other (deeper) feature depths;
however, non-feature depths do not suppress feature depths,
regardless of magnitude (i.e., all feature depths are regarded as being
shoaler than all other depth nodes in the grid). In CARIS, the
Designated flag should be used when a single least depth
measurement is preferred over the weighted-mean depth calculation
for BASE surface grid nodes. Designated soundings often equate to
navigational significance and, hence, the desire for a symbolized
feature to be rendered on the chart—and why HIPS Designated
soundings are read into Pydro as candidate features (items from
bathymetry). However, this is not always the case. For example, if the
area of least depth has been adequately surveyed, yet contains a small
number of soundings, the Designated flag should be used. Also, if a
feature’s least depth was determined by DLDG, the Designated
flagging mechanism must be used to accurately represent the (single)
measurement in the BASE surface. Designated soundings are applied
to the BASE surface during the Finalize step in CARIS by checking
the "Apply designated soundings" option.

Flagging a sounding Outstanding can only be accomplished in HIPS,
but this action correlates to creating a bathymetry feature in Pydro.

In other words, a sounding flagged Outstanding in the HDCS data
will automatically be a bathymetry feature in the PSS. Likewise,
creating a bathymetry feature in Pydro will write an Outstanding flag
back to that sounding in the HDCS data.

Responsibilities

5.1

Hydrographic Vessel or Processing Branch Personnel
 Perform processing tasks to convert raw data into formats usable by the
backscatter mosaicing application.

 Create backscatter mosaic.

 Perform QC on mosaic.

 Deliver to appropriate agency or contact if applicable.

6.

Procedure

6.0

Introduction
This SOP outlines the use of Fledermaus Geocoder Tool Box (FMGT) to QC
backscatter data and/or create backscatter products for submission to NGDC.

The products that will be archived at NGDC are Generic Sensor Files (GSF) or
ALL files, which can be used for further backscatter processing by other
interested parties, and a backscatter mosaic, which advertises the data and can be
used to reveal general differences in bottom composition. The GSF files and ALL
files are the most straightforward point for further processing because they
contain both backscatter and processed bathymetry.

6.1

Software
The latest version of FMGT can be downloaded on the Hydrosoft website. It is
recommended to work on a 64bit machine when possible.

6.3

Import lines into FMGT Project
The GSF files are created by combining backscatter files and the processed depth
files. Backscatter and bathy data from NOAA vessels are typically *.all files
(Kongsberg with SIS) or HSX / 7K pairs (HYPACK with Reson systems), or
*.sdf files (Klien Side scan with Sonarpro). The ALL files can be imported
directly into FMGT because they contain the backscatter and processed depth
information. HSX (bathy) files are processed in CARIS, which creates a CARIS
HDCS data structure containing the ProcessedDepths file. FMGT combines pairs
of 7K files with the HDCS lines based on the files names. SDF files are not
currently supported, but are expected to be importable in the future.

1. Select File &gt; Import &gt; Backscatter Files

3. Select “Add Directory…” and select the directory containing the
corresponding HDCS lines. You can also select specific lines, but this
method is more cumbersome because you need to select the
ProcessedDepths file from each line folder. Since FMGT is matching
files, it is okay to select a directory that contains more files than the 7k
file previously selected. Leave the “Recursive" box checked.

4. The files as paired are now displayed. Ensure correct pairing by
scrolling through the files. A time offset between the HDCS and 7K
files can be provided. This should be “0.0”, but at times the HDCS
data appear to have an offset so “-1.0” should be entered instead.

There is not currently a way to determine if this offset is needed before
processing. If there is a roll artifact in the mosaic, the offset is needed.

5. Select FG_NAD83 for the Horizontal Coordinate system for the
incoming lines, and leave the Vertical Datum as FD_Undefined.

6.4

FMGT Configuration
The FMGT Configuration parameters must be adjusted if processing RESON data
because the RESON TVG curve is not correctly implemented in Geocoder. (If
processing Kongsberg data skip to step 6.5.) If the user forgets to set the
Configuration parameters to the TVG plugin the backscatter may be outside of the
calibrated sonar filter range.

tiles use the Select Mosaic Area function described in section 6.6
above.)
The result is one mosaic per tile.

Troubleshooting
If files fail to convert properly contact Fledermaus support at
http://www.qps.nl/display/fledermaus/support. If a file is oversized (a common
problem on 32bit machines) or you see artifacts of interest in your mosaic contact
Glen Rice at the IOCM center.

6.10

Documenting your Process
Metadata should accompany backscatter products so the products can be
recreated. Include the name of processing software used with version number,
survey number, processor name, plugins used, mosaic resolution, filtering or
beam pattern information (if applicable), and histogram range for the mosaic in a
text document and ile along with the processed backscatter data (GSF and/or
mosics).

Procedure

6.1
General
These are guidelines for the setup and acquisition of a Reson 7000 series multibeam
using Hypack. The goal is to ensure that Reson Snippets are recorded with the sonar
settings at the time of acquisition. Snippets are recorded in the Hypack 7K file if the
correct setup is used in Hypack. The Hypack 7K file must be paired with the HSX file as
the 7K file does not include navigation
6.2

Setup

A. Recording Reson Snippets in Hypack
The following settings should be entered on the Hypack/Hysweep interface:
1. In the Administrator window go to Hysweep Hardware
2. Select the 7125 device and go to the Setup button (in center of the window)

Title:

SOP Guidelines for Backscatter Acquisition Setup and Execution
As a general aside, there are differences between the “Datagram Version 1” and
“Datagram Version2” records. These are the records that HYPACK requests from the
Reson machine. Version 1 records consist of the 7000 (sonar settings) record, 7004
(beam configuration) record, 7006 (bottom detection information) record, 7007 (side
scan) record, and 7008 (snippets) record. Reson has encouraged switching from some of
these records to newer versions. The Version 2 records (as termed by HYPACK) are the
7000 record, 7006 record, 7007 record, 7027 (raw bottom detection and configuration)
record, 7028 (dynamic snippets) record, and 7503 record (sonar settings extended). The
primary advantage of the Version 2 records for backscatter is that the snippet size is set
dynamically (7028 record), but this record is not currently supported in post processing
software. The usage of the 7027 record means the bottom detection must be corrected for
the receiver to transmitter offset, but Hypack is collecting this information through the
7503 record so it is set automatically and does not need to be configured by the user. The
7027 record also contains a real time estimate of uncertainty for each bottom detection.

B. Reson Setup
When acquiring data through HYPACK, HYPACK handles which records are requested,
so no specific setup different than normal survey is needed to ensure proper acquisition
for backscatter. It is recommended that the “Snippet Control” on the Reson machine be
secured to ensure no conflicts with HYPACK. This is found in Configuration &gt; Data
Display & Format. In the Snippets Control section, ensure “Enable Snippets” is
unchecked.

C. The Saturation Monitor
Configuration and setup of the Saturation Monitor is covered in the Saturation Monitor
Manual in Satmon under General &gt; Documentation. Basic usage, assuming correct setup
and configuration has already occurred, is accomplished with the following steps.

1. Start the Saturation Monitor from Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Pydro &gt; Contributions &gt;
Satmon.

2. Select Setup &gt; From Network…
3. Press the Start button at the bottom of the Satmon Window.

4. When finished, press the same button now labeled as Stop.

5. Use General &gt; Exit to close the program.

The purpose is to keep the Reson from saturating, and this is accomplished by keeping
the Reson set so the Saturation Monitor plots are below the displayed zones.

6.3

Multibeam Operation

The adjustment of multibeam settings should be minimized to limit the likelihood of
artifacts in the resulting backscatter products, but changes can be made. Changes in
depth or bottom type will inevitably require setting changes for good bottom detections
which is also required for good backscatter. Sonar setting guidelines are as follows:
Power
Gain
Absorption
Spreading
Pulse Length

190 to 210
0 to 83
Follow Ops instructions, but okay to adjust

*Page 30*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set to 100 microseconds or greater

The sonar operator can change the power, gain, absorption and spreading during survey
operations to maintain good bottom detection throughout the swath without affecting the
backscatter (this is because the system is not saturated).

Changing the pulse length still affects the backscatter, Instead:
 Increase the spreading to improve the outerbeam detections.

 Decrease the power to decrease saturation.

Lower the power slowly, allowing for the projector capacitors to discharge and the output
power to be close to the recorded power.

Bottom detection quality should be monitored as with a normal hydrographic survey, but
in addition the Saturation Monitor should be used. Both displays are useful (found
under the plot menu) and provide slightly different information.

The “Gain vs Receive” plot (Figure 3 left) shows all the bottom detections as a function
of the gain applied to the sounding and the received (uncorrected) backscatter level, and
they are displayed with the saturation curve. Soundings below the curve are estimated to
be in an unsaturated (and linear) state. Changing the absorption and spreading will make
the soundings move up and to the right, but will also spread the soundings out along the
horizontal axis. This is because the outerbeams, which are the soundings more to the
right, have more gain applied because they are further away and so have more time
varying gain applied. Power will move the sounding up and down vertically because it
effects the backscatter strength (vertical axis) but not the gain (horizontal axis).

The “Beam vs Percent Nonlinear” plot displays by beam (horizontal axis) the received
magnitude relative to the maximum allowable magnitude for the applied gain as defined
by the saturation curve. In a nut shell, keep the histogram below the red line and below

also the yellow line when possible. Changing the absorption and spreading will affect the
outer beams more than the inter beams, but power and gain will change them all together.

Figure 3

Power will lower the whole histogram, while absorption and spreading will help push up
the outer beams.

6.4 Quality Check
To ensure that data is actually being collected, one line from each vessel from each day
should be processed in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox (FMGT). Please see the

Combining Grid Requirements
1. OVERVIEW
The goal of this document is to create a combined surface to be referenced while conducting data analysis and
quality assurances during the SAR process. It is best to combine the source grids using the program CARIS
BDB and apply the appropriate combining rules and use the appropriate conflict rule file (*.crfx).
2.

PROCEDURE

The combining process is used to combine multiple source grids into a new output grid to be stored locally or
on a database server. The bathymetric grids are combined when there are adjacent or overlapping surfaces that
one intends to merge into one continuous and complete grid. The resolution of the single combined grid is
usually combined at the coarsest resolution of the source grids. The intent is to maintain the shoalest depths
from the source grids, incorporating to a coarser resolution grid. The combined grid is considered a product
surface such that soundings may be extracted for comparison, conduct quality assurances of the gridded data,
and also for generating the HCell products. Overlapping areas are de-conflicted with the application of userdefined rules. The user defined rules are referenced in a conflict rule file named “BDB_ConflictRules.crfx.”
This file is normally located in the “Reference” sub-directory within the working “AHB” directory. The
conflict file rules are based upon the following criteria and in this order:

1. Depth is least
2. Resolution is least
3.

Uncertainty is least

3. WORK INSTRUCTIONS (SOP)
To combine surfaces:

1.

2.

Open the surfaces that are selected for combining.

Select the Combine command. The Combine Surfaces dialog box is displayed.

Figure 1: Combined Grid, 1

3.

In the Input Surfaces field, while pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, select the surfaces to be combined.

4.

5.

6.

Select Output stored to local disk to save the surface on the local machine
Click Browse (...) to select the Name and location for the output surface.

Click check 2: Options.

Click Browse (...) for the selection of the proper Horizontal projection.

7.

Select the appropriate resolution of the combined surface: for the SAR, this will be the resolution of the
coarsest grid (i.e. if combining a 50cm, 1m and 2m grid the appropriate resolution will be 2m. (Reference
HTD 2010-6)

8.

Next, Click 3: Extents

Figure 2: Combined Grid, 2
9.

Using the cross hairs, select the extent of the combined grid in order to minimize the “white space” that
will be included in the combined grid

Figure 3: Combined Grid, 3

10. Next click, 4: Conflicts

11. In the Conflicts window select &gt; tag Import, then navigate to the following directory within the survey data
directory structure: AHB_HXXXXX\Reference and select the file named “BDB_ConflictRules.crfx.”

Figure 4: Combined Grid, 4

12.

Once one has selected the conflict rules to apply, the “OK” button will become active. Click the “OK”
button to execute the combined grid process

SOP: Ellipsoidally Referenced Surveys

1. OVERVIEW
This SOP outlines processing procedures to process an Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey (ERS).

Any errors or concerns with the technical information herein should be addressed to Corey Allen
(Corey.Allen@noaa.gov)
2. GLOSSARY OF PROCESSING TECHNIQUES
Applanix IN-Fusion Single Baseline “SingleBase” - One dedicated base station is used to process
a tightly coupled solution for short base line processing up to approximately 20km. The base station
may be user-installed or downloaded form the various available networks (CORS/IGS/SOPAC).

Ephemeris corrections should be downloaded to obtain to highest level of precision of ephemeris
available at the time of processing (e.g. Ultra-Rapid, Rapid, Precise).

Applanix IN-Fusion Smartbase – Smartbase processing is based on Trimble VRS technology, the
virtual reference station solution that uses a network of user-installed or continuously operating
reference stations to compute a set of correctors for the roving receiver anywhere within the
network. Smartbase processing requires a minimum of four reference stations surrounding the
rover, but distance to the nearest reference station can be extended to 70km.

Applanix IN-Fusion PPP – Precise Point Positioning is a processing method that provides
positioning accuracies on the order of a few decimetres without needing a reference station. This
application is useful when a reference station cannot be found or installed within allowable distance
tolerances.



If any error logs appear, it is usually because Applanix SmartBase (ASB) was not
satisfied with a base station either because of gaps or cycle slips. Open the message log
and scroll to the ASB Processing log
Look for “Total full data gaps” over 30 seconds. If possible, disable this base station and
rerun the Smartbase Quality Check and ASB. Or, if possible, try selecting/downloading
another station to replace the unsatisfactory base station.

Table 16.3 from Chapter 16 of the POSPac MMS GNSS-Inertial Tools User Manual also provides
some insight to sources of error messages:

http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/components/prods_cb.html - Download site for ephemeris and clock data,
seems to be quicker than downloading through POSGNSS, probably because the clk files are
significantly smaller. Filenames are igsWWWWD.clk and igsWWWWD.sp3 where WWWW is
GPS week and D is the day of the week (0 to 6) starting on 0 being Sunday.

BATCH PROCESSING IN POSPAC 6.1
FOR SINGLEBASE AND SMARTBASE
To optimize time spent processing smooth best estimates of trajectory (SBET)s, a batch file can be
set to run for several POSPac projects at once. Batches can be created for a project, a day, port side,
starboard side, or a combination of all of the above. During active survey ops, it is recommended to
batch by day number. It is necessary to wait until at least four hours after acquisition to post-process
navigation (PPP requires rapid, not ultra-rapid orbit data). A size-restricted internal file in POSPac
MMS does not allow a 24-hour day of POS data to be processed without crashing. Essentially, a 24hour acquisition day batch will produce two SBETs per IMU.


Select Run  Batch Manager



Click the New Batch icon in the upper left corner of the pane



Save the batch configuration file to the POSPAC folder in the appropriate project, use the
naming convention DN###_batch.posbat 
 



In the Batch Editor window 
o Enter a project name: YYYY_DDD_VSSL 
o Navigate to and select the appropriate First File POS data file for the vessel and day 
o The Last File field will auto populate but will need to be set manually if the number
of POS files goes beyond *.099 (i.e. *.100). If that is the case, you need to switch to
view ALL files and select the last file for that day (remembering if it is 24hr
operations the day needs to be split into two projects and there needs to be overlap
for these two project because only one SBET can be loaded to an individual CARIS

SBET QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
Once your POSPac project has processed successfully, you may now do quality control of the
SBETs (Smoothed Best Estimated Trajectories). This can be done manually or automatically. Keep
the SBET Processing Log handy as that should be filled out during the QC process.

Manual Quality Control


In the project window, verify that the post-processed solution (Green Solution, PNAV)
covers the vast majority of the real-time solution (Purple, RNAV) If you see lots of purple
the raw POS file might not have been processed with all the needed days of base station
data, or encountered a fatal error.



SingleBase: Check that the correct Base Station was used for the data, this can just be a
visual check to confirm the base station is in the right position relative to the survey area
For any “aborted” projects, view the message logs



Check each step, and scroll to the bottom, where you should note if the “Termination
status:” is anything other than “Normal.” “Fatal errors” are cause for immediate
concern and further review.



There should be a “forward” “backward” and “smoother” processing, in addition to other
steps. If any of these are missing, a processing error likely occurred.  



Under POS Data Import, ensure that the POS status reached Full Navigation, or at
Least Fine Align, if it did not, note this.



Under IMU Data Continuity note any reported IMU data gaps. IMU data gaps are
typically caused by a data communication failure between IMU and the POS
computer.



In Primary/Secondary GNSS Import, note any decoding errors, likely caused by data
communication failures due to corrupted bytes from the GNSS receiver data stream.

o Altitude. Altitude can be viewed with Total Speed. Odd behaviors in the
Altitude should correspond to changes in the Total Speed. If not, make a
comment in the Remarks section of the Processing Log. Jumps in altitude should
be noted and logged. Such offsets will cause problems if the data is used to
produce ellipsoidally referenced surfaces. Jumps like this can be highly
indicative of other positioning problems.

o Smoothed Estimated Errors. Look at the x , y, and z accelerometer bias values.

If the data fluctuates significantly with time, then make a note in the remarks.

o Number of SV’s. Found under “Smoothed Solution Status.” SVs greater than 7
should give a reliably accurate solution. This should be reviewed with PDOP.  
o PDOP. The PDOP values less than 3 normally give a reliably accurate solution.

The FPM has guidelines to keep this number below 6. If the satellite count drops,
the PDOP value will increase. Monitor PDOP during field acquisition.

o

Processing mode. The best solution would be a 0, or Fixed NL. Disregard
momentary spikes, only log processing modes that have multiple spikes or peaks
that last longer than ~10 minutes

o Smoothed- Reference Data. First, click on Tools, NAVDIF. Under the
Reference Data file, browse to \YYYY_DDD_VSSL\Mission 1\Extract folder
and select vnav_Mission 1.out. Change the Difference Data Output Modulus to
200. Click Difference.

You are differencing the real-time navigation to the SBET solution. When the difference is done,
close the NAVDIF box. A new plot will pop up, called Smoothed- Reference Data. Select North vs.

East position difference (m) You should be looking at an approximately round scatter plot – zoom
into the most dense area of data and approximate the central point of the scatter plot. Log the N/S
(Y-axis) and E/W (X-axis) values of this central point.

This graph can be highly erratic and confusing. Simply give your best approximation of the central
point. What you are looking at is the average distance that POSPac adjusted position by. If the
values are large, it implies poor GPS data, if the values are small, it implies good GPS data,
probably DGPS

o 2D radial position differences (m), generally below 2m is okay.

o 3D radial position differences (m), generally below 3m is okay.

o For any abnormally large spikes, reference the Real-Time Performance Metrics,
North, East and Down Position Errors and compare with the radial position
difference time when there are large jumps in the position differences. If the
radial spike corresponds to any spikes in the Real-time positions, we can assume
the error occurred in real time and was not introduced by the post-processing.



Make a recommendation to apply the SBET
o Apply: You believe the data looks good and have seen no reason to suspect the
data quality
o Apply with inspection: You believe the data looks okay, however you have seen
some questionable values in the data that the sheet manager should be aware of
o Needs troubleshooting: You believe this data is of poor quality, with fatal
errors, or highly suspicious values. This data should not be applied to a sheet

Advanced Troubleshooting and considerations
If you encounter any major issues, one of the key questions will be determining if the vessel
was even logging data during the time of the error. Convert the time displayed on a plot or in
the overview screen into a time to compare to .hsx logging times (or vice versa). If the error
is within logging times, inspect the lines manually and using directed editing techniques.

Files can be reprocessed in POSPAC using alternative processing methods (PPP, Smartbase,
Singlebase) and without using batch and have the resultant solutions compared using plots,
or navdiff the resultant sbets. Start and end times of processing can also be altered to not
process certain parts of the file.

Errors apparent in a given vessel can be compared across the same vessel during different
days, or compared to other vessels at the same time. Many vessels experiencing a similar
error at the same time could imply external sources (Atmosphere, satellites, etc), whereas a
recurring error on one vessel may be indicative of an internal issue (settings, hardware,
software).

Automated SBET QC
This feature allows you to run a small program which requires an input of POSPac Project and the
associated NAVDIF Reference SBET and will output the required metrics including: Smoothed
Performance Metrics, Calibration Installation Parameters, Solution Status Values, and SmoothedReference Data. This method can be used as an alternate to manually going through the individual
plots to get the required metrics as it is much quicker to obtain.

Double click on the AutoQC script to start the program
Run the Auto QC program
1. Open POSPac Project you want to QC 
2. Select Open Reference SBET and navigate to the SBET in the associated POSPac folder 
(YYYY_DDD_VSSL\Mission 1\Proc\sbet_Mission 1.out) 
3. Click Run Auto QC  

This process will output a report that will include all of the quality control metrics that should be
reviewed for an SBET. These values will then be entered into the SBET processing log.

COMPUTE GPS TIDE REFERENCE TABLE
GPS Tide = GPS Height - Datum Height - Dynamic Heave + Remote Heave + Antenna Offset +
Dynamic Draft - Waterline + Height Correction
The GPS Tide calculation is dictated according to how components are included in the formulation,
if at all (per CARIS HelpDesk - Service Request #00800588):
“Apply” =
GPS Tide
Notes
“Remove”
Component Option
Smooth [GPS]
Height

GPS Height time series data may be
smoothed according to smoothing
coefficients computed in HIPS Attitude
Editor.

X

Apply Datum Height "Apply" to subtract a constant offset or
linearly-interpolated offset from a scalar
(gridded) field of offsets to achieve the
desired (ellipsoid-to-chart) datum
transform.

X

Apply Dynamic
Heave

"Apply" to subtract dynamic heave from
the GPS Height. Select this option to
remove dynamic heave from the GPS
Height time series. In particular, if heave
is applied during HIPS "Sound Velocity
Correct", select Apply Dynamic Heave in
the GPS Tide calculation to prevent
double-compensation of heave motion
(assuming heave present in the GPS Height
data).

X

Apply MRU Remote
Heave

"Apply" to subtract remote heave from the
GPS Height. In computing remote heave,
HIPS treats the HIPS Vessel File (HVF)
reference point (RP) as the center of rigid
body rotations for moment arm
calculations. Remote heave is that vertical
component of the moment arm calculation
resulting from an off-RP mounting of the
vessel motion reference unit (MRU). Now,
MRU remote heave is applied when heave
is applied in HIPS "Sound Velocity
Correct"; therefore, Apply MRU Remote
Heave is necessary only when the Apply
Dynamic Heave Option is set (assuming
remote heave not already removed from the
GPS Height data).

Apply Antenna
Offset
(only meaningful if
HVF Navigation
≠IMU)

"Apply" to adjust the GPS Height for rolland pitch-projected antenna vertical
component offset per those x,y,z offsets
entered in the Navigation sensor section of
the HVF. Note that if the GPS Height was
reduced to the HVF RP during data
acquisition, the Navigation offsets in the
HVF would be zeroed; hence, checking
this option would not affect the
computation.

X

Apply Dynamic
Draft

"Apply" to add dynamic draft affects into
the GPS Height time series data. In
particular, if the dynamic draft table in the
HVF is applied during Sound Velocity
Correction (for accurate determination of
the initial conditions for geometric raytracing) it is necessary to apply dynamic
draft in GPS Tide computation.

X

Apply Waterline
Offset
[Simrad only]:
-From Installation
XML, if available

"Apply" to adjust the GPS Height to the
waterline as per the HVF; optionally, for
Simrad, use the waterline value from the
installation XML metadata. RP - WL

Apply Height
Correction

"Apply" to add a constant offset to the GPS
Height time series data.

The “Apply” = “Remove” field is to undo what SV Correction initially did to the observed depths if
these fields are set to “Apply” = Yes in the HVF. This checking to remove paradigm exists in a
Tide/ERS scenario, in a strait ERS paradigm the HVF could be modified to “Apply”=NO at the
project’s onset.

REMOTE DOWNLOAD OF BASE STATION DATA
Connecting to the Ethernet radio
An Ethernet radio is used to communicate with the NetR5. The radio allows for communications
with the base station as if it were part of the internet. Make sure the radio is connected to power and
has the antenna plugged in. The radios have established a connection if the Carrier Detect (CD)
light on the radio is green. Connect the computer to the radio with an Ethernet cable and start a web
browser. Radio settings can be checked using the IP address of the radio in a web browser.

Connecting to the basestation
The NetR5/R9 has a web page interface that allows for easy access through a web browser.

Communications are established by typing the ip address of the base station into the address bar as

SUBMITTING TO Online Positioning User Service (OPUS)
Why Submit?
OPUS is a great tool for getting a very precise position for centimeter accuracy. We use the
position calculated by OPUS to correct for inaccuracies in the acquisition platform’s position. In
addition, Field Procedures say we are required to obtain an OPUS solution from at least a 4 hour
observation on a benchmark. We like to submit our base station position to OPUS when we first
acquire data and then do a weekly submission in order to verify the position is still accurate during
hydrographic acquisition. In order to obtain a precise solution, OPUS can take up to 19 days to
obtain a final precise orbit because it uses a combination of seven analysis centers worldwide and
these centers take several days to upload the orbit data to the International GNSS Service (IGS).
Obtaining a Solution
After creating a RINEX file from the base station receiver raw file you may then submit the file to
OPUS in order to get a precise position solution. If bandwidth is an issue, as it usually is aboard the
ship, you may need to decimate and zip the RINEX file in order to get the file size smaller to
achieve a reasonable upload time (a 3 mb file usually takes about 3-5 minutes to upload on the
ship).

Once your RINEX file size is reasonable, got to the OPUS website at:
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/

From the figure above follow these steps:
1. Enter your email address
2. Browse and select your RINEX file, this is your .10O file

3. Select your antenna type from the dropdown, for FA this will either be the Trimble antenna
(TRM55971.00 Zephyr GNSS Geodetic Model 2) or the Ashtech antenna
(ASH701975.01AGP Geodetic IV, Rev. A with groundplane)
4. Enter your antenna height. This will usually be 1.5 meters, which is what you set your
tripod height to.

5. Click the OPTIONS button. This will take you to the following page

Leave all numbered sections as is except for 4. Extended Output and 5. Draft XML Output. Choose
“Yes” for both of these and they will be included in the OPUS solution emailed to you. At the
bottom section 8. Choose “STATIC” if your observation was more than 2 hours. This will give you
a more precise solution.

After choosing “STATIC” you should receive a pop-up window stating that your file is being
uploaded. Once it is uploaded, it will take some time for OPUS to create a solution. Check your
email in about 15 minutes and you should receive a solution. Once you do, open the email and save
all the text as your OPUS solution. The solution will give you useful information like your antenna
name, antenna height, start and stop times of the observation, and most importantly, your latitude,
longitude, and ellipsoid height (this position is what you will input for your base station coordinates
in POSPAC when processing true heave data).

Type: This describes the surveyed object. For our purposed, the most likely type is a
“D=Disk”. When you choose disk, you will then be given a dropdown to the right of
“Type” which you need to identify the type of disk. In most cases this will be “DB=Bench
mark disk”.

Setting: This is the structure to which the mark is affixed. This can sometimes be found in
the “Bench Mark Descriptions” described above. The most common will be:
o 2 = Object driven into ground
o 66 = In rock outcrop or ledge
o 80 = In a boulder
Descriptions: Describe new marks by noting distances and directions to local witnesses
(posts, trees, curbs, etc.) along with any other salient features (recommended approach,
hazards, etc.). This will help future surveyors recover and assess the suitability of your
mark. In most cases you can find a suitable description in the “Bench Mark Descriptions”
described above.

Stability: This is your best estimate of the mark's ability to maintain a long-term, constant
position relative to other local features. Consider the setting quality, soil type, threats from
construction or traffic, etc.

Magnetic: Copper, brass, aluminum, and stainless steel are not magnetic. Alloys containing
iron, cobalt or nickel are magnetic. Use a magnet to test. Most of the marks we recover are
not magnetic.

Once this is complete, click on the “Continue” button.

USING POSPAC MMS TO COMPUTE VESSEL OFFSETS
It is possible to post-process the POSMV files recorded during the GAMS calibration to refine
offsets between the IMU reference point and the primary antenna phase center. The GAMS
calibration data is used because in general it is the most dynamics that a vessel will see. This helps
resolve the offsets quickly in post processing and to a higher degree of confidence.

Processing
The general idea is to process the POSMV data multiple times at the 10cm confidence level. Each
time inputting the resulting calibrated installation parameters as the initial lever arm offsets for the
following run. This is repeated until the resulting offsets vary by only millimeters.

Process the SBET in POSPac and QC the solution.

To get statistically robust final values for the calibrated installation parameters there is a macro that
runs in Pydro. Open Pydro, on the menu bar select Misc  Run Macro. Select
CalcPOSMViincalLeverArmStats.py

Navigate to and check the project name, click descend/confirm, this will find the “Proc” folder.

Then click Apply, it will look like nothing happened. In the background behind the Pydro window
is the command prompt associated with Pydro the macro will have output the data in this window.

ELLIPSOIDALLY REFERENCED DYNAMIC DRAFT MODEL (ERDDM)
Analysis Using the Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft

Step One: Establish desired tide package in Pydro: (a) Discrete Zoned Tides or (b) TCARI
1 (a) If you have Discrete Zoned Tides (ZDF + .TID(s))
From Pydro's main menu, Tides &gt; Load Zoning Data (.ZDF)
Tides &gt; CO-OPS Office Tools &gt; Download Zoned Tide Stations
- Pydro console window will echo a "trying to download stations" list
- If you have problems, or you don't otherwise have internet access, you can consult with HSD and
your HSTP representative to obtain a stations file for your ERDDM analysis. Such a station file is
loaded "manually" via Tides &gt; CO-OPS Office Tools &gt; Load Zoned Tide Stations
&lt;OR&gt;
1 (b) If you have TCARI Tides
From Pydro's main menu, Tides &gt; Load TCARI Data (.tc)

Step Two: (a) Examine discrete or TCARI zones and (b) load/view water levels
2 (a) To see the ZDF or TCARI zones in a Chart Window
Window &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Display Properties (or F3 key if Pydro window frame has focus)
- Plotting tab: Check "Tides" in Auto Draw & Middle Button Mouse Draw
- Press the Zoom to Chart Overview (Globe toolbar button) on Chart Window, then Middle Button
on mouse to refresh the display--drawing zones
&lt;AND&gt;
2 (b) To load water level data for both discrete and TCARI zones in a Chart Window

Step Three: Analyze the ERDDM data via the Pydro macro
3 Misc &gt; Run Macro - browse/select ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py (should be present in the default
directory in the dialog: &lt;Pydro install path&gt;/Lib/site-packages/HSTP/Pydro/Macros)
- Browse to select ERDDM POSProc SBET file--either binary (.out) or ASCII (.txt) will work
- Enter year-doy of start of ERDDM data
- Enter start/ end times [units are seconds-of-GPS-week]; it defaults to the min/max of the SBET
file
- The data analysis graphs and dynamic draft table appropriate for use in CARIS HIPS will pop up
shortly thereafter
Notes:
- While both binary (.out) and ASCII (.txt) POSProc SBET data files may be used, height
uncertainty data is not available in the binary files. If you want to use the POSProc height
uncertainty, export SBET data to ASCII and process that with the ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py
- The tide correction may take some time, especially in the case of 200 Hz (undecimated) SBET
data. The Console Window that accompanies Pydro will show progress, counting through the
number of tide look-ups performed. Left at 200 Hz, an dynamic draft calibration SBET file may
require on the order of one million tide "corrector" look-ups.

- Figure 1 Ellipsoid Height [m] vs. time is for entire SBET file data; i.e., to help ascertain start/end
times to clip the SBET data for all subsequent analysis and plots. Note that this height plot is
uncorrected for tide; compare to subsequent graphs which are tide corrected. You may have to
select the Figure 1 tab on the Windows system task bar to make it visible on your Desktop.

- Figure 2 Altitude [m] is corrected for tide and records are per start/end clipping. The two standard
deviation value from this figure should be entered into the HVF TPU section for delta draft.

- Figure 3 is the resulting speed vs. draft appropriate for use in a CARIS HIPS HVF.

ELLIPSOIDALLY REFERENCED ZONED TIDES
An alternative option in areas lacking a published VDatum model is to relate "traditional" zoned
water levels to the ellipsoid. This is done by measuring the height of the GPS antenna to the water
line. Then a SEP is created by adding this ellipsoidally-referenced water line measurement to the
zoned water level “corrector.” The SEP is then applied to the ellipsodially-referenced hydrography
to reference it to chart datum. ERS-ERZT data may be readjusted at a later date when VDatum
coverage becomes available. Additional tools and documentation will be made available via a
Hydrographic Technical Directive later this year.

Contents:
1|Background
2|Creation of Checksums
3|Verification of Checksums
4|Reporting Results

1| Background
A checksum or hash sum is a fixed-size datum computed from an arbitrary block of digital data for the
purpose of detecting accidental errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or
storage. The integrity of the data can be checked at any later time by recomputing the checksum and
comparing it with the stored one.

NOAA field units shall create MD5 checksums for all digital data submitted to the processing branches.
This SOP outlines the procedure for creating, verifying, and reporting the results of the verification
process using the program FileVerifier++.

This SOP is intended to be used with FileVerifier++ version 0.6.3.5830W or later.

2| Creation of Checksums
To create checksums, first copy all the digital data to be submitted to the processing branch to the
submission drive. Once all the data has been copied, create a MD5 checksum file with Unix Line
Endings, Unix Path Separator Characters and a custom MD5 file comment using the following procedure:
1. Open FileVerifier++ by opening the fv.exe file from Windows Explorer
2. If this is the first time you have run the program, go to Tools -&gt;Settings-&gt;Preferences

a. Under General -&gt;Compatibility change
i. Line Endings for Text Files to Unix (LF)
ii. Path Separator Character to Unix (/)

b. Under General-&gt;File Comments change
i. Default File Comment to “Hexadecimal MD5 checksums created at {insert field
unit name here} on YYYY-MM-DD”
ii. Check Prompt For Comment Upon Save

c. Under Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Default Encoding-&gt; Select “Hexadecimal”
d. Under Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Select “Use relative paths when adding files”

e. Under Algorithms-&gt; Select “MD5”

3. Once you have all your settings correct, you can add the files to be checksumed
a. Select the “Dirs” button and browse to the H12345 folder on the submission
drive
b. Under Operations-&gt; Select “Calculate Entries [ALL]…”

c. Enter the base path of the submission folder (ex. T:\H12345) in the Relative path names
entry dialog and click okay

d. The process will begin and you will get a status bar telling you how far along you are

e. When it is finished, click on the “Save” button
i. Give the checksum file a name using the naming convention
HXXXXX_Checksums.MD5 and place it in the base folder (ex T:\H12345)
ii. Save as “MD5 Hashes (MD5SUM Style) (*.MD5)”

iii. Answer “Yes” to the question about relative path stripping

iv. Modify the date in the comments to the current date

3| Verification of Checksums
To verify checksums, first copy all the submitted digital data to the network drive where it will be stored.
Then verify that the data has not been altered by loading the checksum file and comparing the
checksums of the files as they currently exists to how they existed on the ship using the following
procedure:
1. Open FileVerifier++ by opening the fv.exe file from Windows Explorer
2. If this is the first time you have run the program, go to Tools -&gt;Settings-&gt;Preferences

a. Under General -&gt;Compatibility change
i. Line Endings for Text Files to Unix (LF)
ii. Path Separator Character to Unix (/)

b. Under Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Default Encoding-&gt; Select “Hexadecimal”

c. Under Algorithms-&gt; Select “MD5”

3. Open the MD5 Checksum file by clicking on the “Load” button

a. If you have” Verify files automatically” selected in the Tools-&gt;Settings menu, the
comparison will begin automatically.

b. If not, under Operations-&gt; Select “Verify Entries [ALL]…”

c. The Relative path names entry dialog should already be pointing to the current root
folder but if not, point to it now and click OK.

d. The process will begin and you will get a status bar telling you how far along you are

4. When the verification process is complete, sort the columns by “Verification”. If any files have
been altered or deleted between the field unit and the processing branch network they will
show up as Invalid and be colored red. These files will need to be re-transmitted from the field
unit to the processing branch.

5. If all files have valid checksums then a report shall be created noting this

4| Reporting Results
If you have successfully verified all files in the submission, report the results of the verification using the
following procedure:
1. Select the Loading Results and Verifying Files text from the Message Log window

2. Copy the text to a new text file in the submission root folder which is named with the naming
convention HXXXXX_Checksum_Results.txt

1. OVERVIEW
The Total Vertical Uncertainty Quality Check (TVU QC) is a simple way to identify nodes in the
submitted grid that have estimated uncertainties that exceed the NOAA specifications. The NOAA
uncertainty standards are based on IHO S-44 standards for hydrographic surveys. Specifically, the
TVU QC layer compares the estimated uncertainty of the depth estimate to the allowable
uncertainty of the depth estimate node by node.

There are multiple methods to identify the nodes that have estimated uncertainties that exceed the
NOAA specifications. The best practice is to use the ratio method which visualizes the ratio of the
uncertainty at a node to the maximum allowed IHO uncertainty for each node via a computed layer
in CARIS. This TVU QC layer scales with depth and demonstrates what fraction of the total
allowable error budget is consumed by the estimated uncertainty. In addition, only one new CUBE
child layer is required for each IHO Order (1 or 2).

2. WORK INSTRUCTIONS
The Compute Layer function is used in CARIS HIPS & SIPS or CARIS BDB to create a new
custom attribute layer from one or more existing layers. The hydrographer should use the Finalized
surface because this surface will identify areas where either the uncertainty or the standard
deviation exceeded the maximum allowable error and the greater of these two values is used in
addition to having the Uncertainty scaled to a 95% CI, whereas unfinalized surface Uncertainties
are reported at the 68% CI.

The IHO Order specifications change with depth. Use the following guidelines for determining the
IHO Order specification:



IHO Order 1 for 1m, 2m, 4m, and 8m surfaces.

IHO Order 2 for 8m, 16m, and 32m surfaces.

Note: Two layers should be created for 8m surfaces for evaluation: IHO-1 layer 72-100m and IHO2 layer 100-160m.

Ratio Method
2.1 Create TVU QC Layer
a. Select the parent layer of the surface in the Layers window.

b. Open Compute Layer Window:
i. HIPS & SIPS -&gt; Right-click and select ‘Add Layer’
ii. BDB -&gt; Select Tools-&gt;Layers-&gt;Compute Layer.

2.2 Review the TVU QC Layer
The results from the ratio method visually demonstrate if and by how much the estimated
uncertainties have exceeded the NOAA specifications. The properties of the TVU QC layer can be
modified to improve visualization. Specifically the user should use the most appropriate Colour
Map file or create a Colour Range template. If using a Colour Range template the values which do
not require further examination are from -1 to 0 and the values which do require further
examination are from -100 to -1, however the ranges should be broken down into finer collections
so the user can take advantage of showing the fraction of allowable error budget.

The TVU QC layer should be examined not only for the 95% confidence level but also for spatial
indicators such as different uncertainty behavior between lines, patterns and/or clusters of noncompliant nodes which may indicate a systematic error, TPU model error, or noisy data.
The TVU QC layer is one tool for evaluating the TVU. The hydrographer should use the TVU QC
layer in conjunction with other tools such as a distribution (e.g. histogram) plot, the Python
“Standards Compliance Evaluation” tool by Weston Renoud, spreadsheets and the CUBE layers.

Histograms can be created in CARIS using the Compute Statistics function. Select the parent layer
of the surface -&gt; Right Click -&gt; Compute Statistics. Select the IHO_Order_1(or2) layer and a bin
size.

1. OVERVIEW
CARIS Notebook may be used to apply tide correctors to point features. However, if a TCARI tide
method is required then Pydro must be used to create the compatible tide file. This SOP describes
how Pydro is used to create a CARIS “single station” tide file (.tid) that is a 1:1 ratio with the
feature records.

2. WORK INSTRUCTIONS
CARIS Notebook:
2.1 Export the features
Export the features that need to be tide corrected to S-57 .000 (or GML) format. This file will be
used by a utility in Pydro as a "navigation" file to create the .tid file.

a. Perform a feature selection in Notebook. The utility in Pydro uses the NOAA extended
attribute "obstim" in computing the tide records. To select features with the “obstim”
attribute populated (i.e. not equal to null), right click and Create Layer by Attribute
Value with the following:

b. File-&gt;Export-&gt;To S-57 (or GML will also work).

Pydro:
2.2 Generate TCARI .tid file
a. Load the desired TCARI project data. No other data needs to be loaded/inserted into the
Pydro Survey Session (PSS) to use the utility.

b. Select Tides-&gt;CARIS TCARI Tide-&gt;Create TCARI TID File via S-57, and select the S57 file from step 1). (Note: there are menu options to opt for PREDICTED tides as
generated by TCARI; if you want predicted tides rather than TCARI tides, use that menu
option.)

CARIS Notebook:
2.3 Correct the features for tide
a. Perform a feature selection in Notebook, using the same query from step 1)
b. Go to Tools-&gt;Load Tide -&gt;Single tide station observations: browse and select the .tid file
created in step 2).

SSS Contacts to $CSYMB
02/27/2014
Overview
This SOP outlines the procedures for NOAA field units to translate CARIS SIPS side scan sonar
contacts to Cartographic Symbols ($CSYMB) in a .000 format for further analysis in CARIS
BDB. This is the most efficient method because Pydro automatically creates the $CSYMB
features, attaches the CARIS SIPS images to the $CSYMB feature and packages the images in to
a single zipped folder which can be extracted to the Multimedia folder.

CARIS HIPS & SIPS
 Pick and attribute contacts.

Pydro
 Config -&gt; User Preferences
 Toggle ON “Auto $CSYMB SIPS contacts on insert; w/ images” and the appropriate SSS
contact image (Mosaic, Speed Corrected, or Uncorrected). All three can be exported but
this will create three copies of each image.





Insert SSS Lines which contain contacts
o Data -&gt;Insert HIPS/SIPS Line Features
 Select Lines with SSS contacts to insert
 Apply
Export SSS Contacts to .000
o Data -&gt; Export -&gt; S-57 Features to ISO 8211 (.000)
o Use “Default” as Filter
o Name .000 $CSYMB file
o Intended Usage = Harbor (5)

WinZip
 Unzip new SSS contact image folder - Pydro automatically zips all images which are
correlated to SSS contacts. The zip file is written to the same folder as the .000 file.

Unzip the image file to your Multimedia folder.

CARIS
 Open SSS contact $CSYMB .000 file for analysis with surfaces and Final Feature File.
