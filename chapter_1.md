Chapter 1
===========
Systems Preparation & Maintenance
NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey (OCS) uses a wide array of systems, tools, and procedures to perform modern
hydrographic surveys. Due to the variety of equipment and highly technological nature of operations, a consistent,
well-documented program of systems preparation and maintenance is essential to ensure that NOAA’s hydrographic
field units are capable of producing data that will meet OCS specifications. These procedures can be broken down
into two categories: Annual Systems Preparation and Periodic Quality Assurance.



1.1 Annual Systems Preparation
-------------------------------

Each field unit shall schedule an adequate period of time for Annual Systems Preparation, typically during
winter inport for ships, in which survey systems will undergo annual calibration, maintenance, and verification
procedures as defined in this chapter. These procedures should also be performed following any significant period
of inactivity and after major changes or upgrades to a field unit’s hydrographic systems. Unless specifically stated
otherwise or assistance is arranged from another NOAA office, Systems Preparation should be conducted and
documented by field unit personnel.

As a final step in Annual Systems Preparation, prior to the start of survey data acquisition, each field unit shall
perform a Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review as described in section 1.1.1. This process is simply a formal
review of each hydrographic field unit’s Annual Systems Preparation.


### 1.1.1 Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review

The primary purpose of the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) is to officially document and
inform OCS senior-level management of a field unit’s level of readiness to perform hydrographic surveys that will
meet OCS specifications. This procedure also affords field units the opportunity to identify any deficiencies that
will prevent optimal performance and production throughout the field season. These deficiencies may include such
items as damaged or unreliable equipment, unmet training needs, and personnel shortages. Formally documenting
field unit requirements will better prepare OCS to provide support and meet the needs of NOAA’s hydrographic
fleet. The Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review process can be broken down into four basic steps outlined
below.

1.	 Hydrographic Systems Review Team Organization. A Hydrographic Systems Review Team shall be organized
for each NOAA hydrographic field unit. This team shall consist of an assigned OCS Representative, typically
a hydrographer from either the Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB) or the Pacific Hydrographic Branch
(PHB), the regional Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) Field Support Liaison, and the
field unit’s Field Operations Officer (FOO) or equivalent.

2.	 Hydrographic Systems Review. The Hydrographic Systems Review Team shall examine both physical
survey systems and documentation for Annual Systems Preparation requirements outlined in this chapter.

*Page 1*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


After completion of the review, this team shall brief the Chief-of-Party on the level of field unit readiness
determined,any deficiencies identified, and any recommendations that could increase the unit’s data quality or
general survey efficiency.

3. Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo. Within ten working days of commencing survey operations,
the Chief-of-Party shall notify OCS of the field unit’s hydrographic systems status and level of readiness
to complete its assigned OCS hydrographic survey mission. This notication shall be an email submission
consisting of a digitally signed Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review Memo (see Appendix 1) that lists
system deficiencies identified during the Hydrographic Systems Review and a plan to address each problem.
Any modications or restrictions in operations that will be necessary in the interim must also be identified.This
digitally signed memo should be sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. Files shall be named using the following format
<UNITNAME_HSRR_MMDDYYYY.pdf>. For additional HSRR memos, add Adendum or Amendment
<UNITNAME_HSRR_Adendum1_MMDDYYYY.pdf>. This digitally signed memo should be sent to ocs.

hsrr@noaa.gov. The following people receive e-mail sent to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov:
	

(a) Chief and Deputy Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division (HSD)

	

(b) Chief and Deputy Chief, Navigation Services Division (NSD)

	

(c) Chief, Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP)

	

(d) Chief, Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB)

	

(e) Chief, Pacific Hydrographic Branch (PHB)

	

(f) Chief, HSD Operations Branch

	

(g) Chief, NSD Navigation Response Branch (NRB)

4. Hydrographic Systems Readiness Acknowledgment. Within ten working days of receiving the Hydrographic
Systems Readiness Review Memo, the Chief of HSD or Chief of NSD shall formally acknowledge receipt via
digital memorandum to the field unit’s Chief-of-Party with a copy to ocs.hsrr@noaa.gov. This memorandum
of acknowledgment shall also state OCS acceptance, qualified acceptance, or rejection of the field unit’s
hydrographic systems readiness. If systems readiness is partially accepted or rejected, the memorandum shall
list any specific actions required by OCS for the field unit to meet data quality standards.



1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance
-------------------------------

Periodic Quality Assurance refers to any additional procedures required by OCS to maintain or verify continued
data quality between annual Hydrographic Systems Reviews. These procedures vary by equipment type and are
generally performed on a scheduled basis throughout a unit’s field season. Specific requirements are organize by
system type and defined in this chapter.



1.3 Basic Methods and Documentation
------------------------------------

To effectively manage a field unit’s hydrographic systems, a comprehensive inventory must first be completed,
and then continually maintained. A standard format for a Hydrographic Systems Inventory has been implemented

*Page 2*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


by OCS, as described in section 1.3.1 . OCS has further established a standardized hydrographic system database,
HiBase, which may be utilized for recording this inventory as described in section 1.3.2. HiBase is intended to
serve as a centralized database that retains and archives all vessels and hydrographic hardware and software used
fleet-wide.

The Hydrographic Systems Inventory is a critical element of systems documentation for both Annual Systems
Preparation and changes occurring throughout a unit’s field season. Preparation and maintenance requirements will
vary, typically by survey system category and type. While Periodic Quality Assurance procedures are relatively
easy to manage, the sheer quantity and variety of tasks to be completed during AnnualSystems Preparation can
be daunting. OCS-recommended methods for meeting both Annual Systems Preparation and Periodic Quality
Assurance requirements for standard hydrographic survey systems are described in detail in sections 1.4 of this
document. However, unless stated that the field unit shall or must follow a specific procedure, these methods are
not mandatory. Field units are encouraged to develop more efficient and/or accurate methods in consultation with
HSD and HSTP personnel. Note: Any new procedures used must be documented with sufficient detail for the
process to be recreated. Systems documentation shall meet the minimum guidelines set forth in this chapter and
use digital reporting formats supplied in Appendix 1. Each of the forms provided in Appendix 1 has been designed
to include essential information. The bulk of systems documentation is to be maintained by the field unit and made
available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Documentation designed
for continual maintenance, such as the Hydrographic Systems Inventory spreadsheet, should be used to capture
changes that occur throughout a field season.


### 1.3.1 Hydrographic Systems Inventory

Each field unit shall complete and maintain a digital Hydrographic Systems Inventory addressing the four systems
categories described below. This information shall be recorded using the format provided below.

•	 Vessels - Include all vessels to be used for hydrographic data acquisition. For new vessels or platform types
not commonly used in OCS hydrography, additional descriptive information with diagrams and/or picture
should be included
•	 Hardware Systems - Include all hardware systems to be used to acquire hydrographic survey data.
•	 Software Systems - Include all software to be used to acquire or manipulate hydrographic survey data.
•	 Personnel Roster - Include all personnel within the field unit who will be actively involved in survey operations.
As this inventory will typically change over the course of the field season or surveying period, the Hydrographic
Systems Inventory shall be updated as changes occur and submitted as Appendix I of the Data Acquisition and
Processing Report (DAPR) for each project.


### 1.3.2 HiBase (Hydrographic Inventory Database)

Field units may opt to use HiBase, a standardized hydrographic inventory database developed by the Coast Survey
Development Laboratory (CSDL), for recording and maintaining their Vessel, Hardware Systems and Software
Systems inventories per section 1.3.1 . Field personnel may register for a HiBase user account at
https://hibase.noaa.gov.

1.4 Vessels
-------------

Vessels are the most fundamental systems in hydrography. Accurate measurement of the dimensions and dynamic
parameters of these platforms is essential to obtain high quality survey data. Vessel “calibration” consists of
measuring, and estimating error for, static parameters such as the physical positions of instruments and equipment
on a vessel, as well as dynamic parameters such as waterline and dynamic draft. Measurement, verification, and
documentation of static parameters are addressed in section 1.4.1 . Dynamic parameters are discussed in section
1.4.2 	 .


### 1.4.1 Vessel Static Offsets

Static offsets of a vessel and its instrumentation are measured for the purpose of establishing a local referenceframe
to which all soundings and positions will be tied. Thus, errors in these measurements will directly translate to
errors in survey data acquired by that vessel. Because much of the equipment installed on vessels remains fixed
from year to year, it may not be necessary to perform a full survey of every platform during Annual Systems
Preparation.

If the results of a previous survey are available and well documented, and the vessel’s configuration has not
changed, simply verifying the existing values should be sufficient. Even when instrumentation has been moved,
if the reference frame is based on a network of benchmarks independent of the movable equipment, it may be
possible to reposition instruments within the fixed network rather than resurvey the entire vessel. This procedure
will result in a significant savings of time and effort, but it is imperative that the original survey be completely and
accurately documented to be effective.

The following items shall be positioned as part of any static offset survey conducted for a NOAA hydrographic
survey platform:
•	 Permanent benchmarks - Benchmarks shall be sufficient in number and position to maintain the vessel
reference frame if instrumentation is disturbed.

•	 Sonar transducers - All vertical beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and hull mounted side scan
sonars that may be used to acquire hydrographic survey data shall be positioned. Transducers mounted on
poles, levers, or other movable mounts should be surveyed in their fully deployed position. Offsets shall be
measured to the transducer’s phase center, or the origin of the sonar’s local reference frame. OCS recommends
also documenting measurements to a nearby permanent mounting point, for reference if the sonar head must
be removed or replaced. Consult the corresponding manufacturer’s documentation for further guidance on the
location of transducer phase centers.

•	 GPS antennae - All survey system GPS antennas shall be positioned. This includes any GPS antennas that are
integrated with differential beacon receivers and typically only used for differential corrections but could pote
tially be used to acquire complete survey position data. Antennas capable of receiving differential correctors
only do not need to be surveyed. Offsets shall be measured to the phase center of each antenna, a point
which may be located inside the antenna’s housing. Consult the corresponding manufacturer’s documentation
to determine the phase center location of a specific antenna type. OCS recommends also documenting
measurements to the permanent mounting post for reference if the antenna must be removed or replaced.
•	 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - For all vessels equipped with a POS/MV system, measurements shall
be made to the origin of the POS/MV IMU’s local reference frame. The manufacturer’s documentation will
define the IMU’s local reference frame and identify its origin.


*Page 4*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 Reference Point (RP) - A RP shall be established and positioned for each vessel. This point will define the origin
of the local vessel reference frame to which all survey data will be tied. Note: OCS strongly recommends that
a vessel’s RP be established at the vessel’s approximate center of motion (as defined below) and coincident
with the origin of the IMU’s local reference frame on vessels equipped with a POS/MV system. By collocating
these three points, the number of physical offset measurements required will be reduced, thus minimizing
sources of error in position and attitude data.

•	 Center of Motion (CM) - A CM shall be defined and positioned for each vessel. Establish this point at an
approximate location at which the vessel’s roll, pitch, and yaw axes intersect during static conditions and
average loading. The location of a vessel’s true center of motion will vary based on a combination of hull
shape, loading conditions, and vessel speed; thus it is a dynamic point. However, a fairly accurate estimation
can be made using the vessel’s plans and empirical observation. Field units should contact NOAA’s Marine
Engineering Division (MED) for assistance when defining a vessel’s CM.

•	 Towpoint - If the vessel is equipped to perform towed sonar operations, the towpoint shall be positioned. The
position of the towpoint is defined as the last point of contact between the tow cable and the vessel, typically
the top of a sheave over which the tow cable is led. If the sonar is towed from a movable point (J-arm,
A-frame, etc.), it shall be in its fully deployed position for this measurement.


#### 1.4.1.1 Vessel Measurement Requirements & Methods

Vessel measurement procedures vary depending on whether the intent is to complete a full survey of a vessel,
conduct a partial survey to position new or disturbed instrumentation within an existing reference frame, or
simply verify existing offsets when no known changes have occurred. The requirements and methods for each of
these scenarios are described below.


##### 1.4.1.1.1 Full Survey

A full survey of a hydrographic vessel is required when no prior survey exists or under any circumstances where
all previous surveys are determined to be unusable. Full vessel surveys should be conducted by National Geodetic
Survey (NGS) personnel or a professional geodetic surveyor. Full vessel surveys can be both time consuming and
expensive; thus, proper documentation is important to preserve the value of this work.

Examples of conditions that would require full surveys include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	 A vessel is new or will be engaged in hydrography for the first time.

•	 Significant modifications have been made to the vessel since the last full survey.

•	 New equipment is installed or existing equipment is repositioned, and the items cannot be accurately referenced
to benchmarks from a prior survey.

•	 New technology or techniques become available that would significantly increase the accuracy of offset
measurements or error estimates for the vessel.

•	 Complete documentation of the previous survey, including offset values, error estimates, and procedure
descriptions, is not available.


*Page 5*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 The hydrographer discovers blunders or unexplained discrepancies when verifying the results of a previous
offset survey. See section 1.4.1.1.3.

•	 The vessel is involved in an incident, such as a grounding, that has altered the positions of benchmarks
and instrumentation, affecting the validity of the previous survey.The goal of a full survey is to establish a
completely new three dimensional local vessel reference frame that is independent of any prior vessel surveys
conducted. Information from existing surveys shall not be incorporatedinto any full survey.

General Considerations for Full Surveys
Accuracy Requirements - OCS has not defined specific numerical values for required offset measurement accuracy.
However, errors introduced in the offset measurement process will be combined with errors from other sources to
produce a final Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) for each sounding. Measurement errors must be accurately
estimated and small enough for vessel data to meet OCS survey specifications. More accurate vessel surveys will
leave additional room in the error budget for other sources of error, which may allow the hydrographer to retain
more data or operate under more adverse conditions than would be possible with a low accuracy survey. Note:
Some integrated position and attitude sensors in use on NOAA platforms, such as the Applanix POS M/V, do
have specific accuracy requirements for offset measurements between system components during installation.
Hydrographers should review the manufacturer’s documentation for any system-specific requirements.
Benchmarks - Benchmarks are permanent, known positions on the vessel used to identify the established local
reference frame. They may be either existing points, such as antenna posts or well defined features of the vessel,
or monuments specifically created or installed for the purpose of the survey. Examples of monuments are punch
marks, scribe marks, or survey disks. Hydrographers shall avoid establishing vessel reference frames that utilize
impermanent features of the vessel as benchmarks. The following two factors should be considered when
selecting or installing benchmarks: (1) Permanence - Benchmarks should be permanent features fixed to the
vessel’s hull or superstructure. Instruments are typically not appropriate benchmarks because of their potential to
be moved. If points such as sensors, antennae, or transducers are used as benchmarks, the reference frame maybe
invalidated if the equipment is removed, replaced, or relocated. (2) Accessibility and Location - Benchmarks
should be established in locations that are protected, but can be readily accessed for future surveys. OCS strongly
recommends establishing benchmarks near hydrographic instruments such as sonar heads and antennae. Doing so
will allow sensors to be accurately reintegrated into the network if they are moved. Since these benchmarks are
used to establish a three dimensional reference frame on the vessel, three benchmarks should be readily accessible
from each instrument location to accurately position sensors, regardless of vessel attitude.

Selection of a Reference Point - Every benchmark network must have a defined origin (i.e., a reference point)
for the local reference frame. OCS recommends locating this point at the vessel’s approximate center of motion
during static conditions and average loading, as discussed in section 1.4.1 Error Estimation - Accurate error
estimates for a vessel survey are as important as the offset measurements themselves. While specific sources of
error are inherent to each method of survey (see Surveying Methods below), the following common factors affect
the accuracy of all vessel offset surveys.

Setups - This term refers to the number of individual measurements required to compute the relative position
of two benchmarks, literally the number of times the surveyor’s instruments must be set up to complete the
measurement. Multiple setup measurements use intermediate points as temporary benchmarks between the two
desired points. Physically positioning the measurement instrument on or over a benchmark or other reference
point is a possible source of error, so multiple setups can increase the measurement error between two points.
Hydrographers should attempt to minimize the number of setups required between benchmarks and record the
number of setups for each leg of the survey.


*Page 6*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Redundancy - If possible, the hydrographer should arrange the survey such that no benchmark is tied to the
rest of the network by only one measurement. Ideally, each benchmark should be tied directly to multiple other
benchmarks. In cases where vessel layout makes this impractical, multiple measurements along the same leg
maybe useful. These additional data can be used to improve the accuracy of positions generated by the survey.
While redundant positions can simply be averaged, a more accurate method of determining a final value is to
combine measurements using a least squares algorithm.

Total Error - When estimating the total error for one leg of a vessel offset survey, individual measurement errors
are combined using a “root sum squared” method, rather than simple addition. For example, in the case of a two
setup measurement, the final error estimate for the leg would be computed as follows:

where ó is the standard deviation of the total measurement, ó1 is the standard deviation of the measurement from
the first benchmark to the temporary benchmark, and ó2 is the standard deviation of the measurement from the
temporary benchmark to the second benchmark.

Vessel Leveling - Although it is possible to establish a vessel reference frame that is not aligned with the vessel
itself, this adds an element of complication and potential error that is best avoided. The vessel surveying process
is much simpler if the vessel is removed from the water and leveled relative to the earth. For ships, this may not
be possible, but launches can generally be accommodated using trailers or jack stands. If a ship is to be surveyed
during a dry dock period, measurements must be corrected for the slope of the vessel on the marine railway.
This angle can be determined by referencing marine growth along the ship’s waterline prior to pressure washing.
Subsequent offset measurements will need to be corrected for the determined angle of inclination.
Surveying Methods
For the purposes of this manual, offset measurement techniques are broken into the following two categories:
“Traditional” Methods - these methods refer to conducting a vessel offset survey using tools such as steel
measuring tapes, T-squares, plumb bobs, and laser or carpenter’s levels. While these instruments can yield very
exact measurements, particularly on small vessels such as launches, this technique relies on the assumption that
the vessel is level and true. With this method, the surveyor uses the existing planes and axes of the vessel’s
construction, such as the deck, door frames, and keel lines, to establish the local reference frame. Not only can
significant error be introduced if the vessel is not actually level and true, it can also be more difficult to estimate
error using traditional methods. OCS recommends using advanced survey methods if equipment and expertise
are available.

“Advanced” Methods - these methods employ precision survey equipment such as theodolites, laser range
finders, total stations, and optical levels. One advantage of using these optical techniques is that measurements are
independent of the vessel’s attitude and alignment. Since the surveying instrument can be positioned anywhere
convenient, measurements between benchmarks can often be accomplished with a single setup, thereby minimizing
error. Detailed procedures for conducting vessel surveys using advanced methods have not been established by
OCS. Field units desiring a full vessel survey using advanced methods should consult the regional HSTP Field
Support Liaison before proceeding. Assistance using these techniques may also be available through the National
Geodetic Survey (NGS) Geodetic Services Division.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



##### 1.4.1.1.2 Partial Survey

A partial vessel survey shall be conducted if minor changes have been made to the vessel configuration, but the
most recent full survey has not been rendered obsolete. Partial surveys are typically appropriate when equipment
is removed and replaced or repositioned on a vessel without disturbing the network of permanent benchmarks.
In such cases, the new position of the instrument can be determined by surveying its position relative to the
undisturbed benchmarks. The original survey shall then be updated and would remain valid Partial surveys are
significantly less time consuming than full surveys, but are only valid if benchmarks installed as part of the
original survey remain undisturbed. When in doubt as to whether a new full survey is necessary or a partial survey
is sufficient, field units shall complete a full survey of the vessel.

Partial surveys are basically identical to full surveys, but on a much smaller scale. The same rules and considerations
described for full surveys apply to partial surveys. Since measurements are typically made over short distances
and require few setups (assuming benchmarks have been installed near instrumentation as recommended), good
accuracy can often be achieved with traditional survey methods. However, advanced methods may provide a more
accurate estimate for measurement error.


##### 1.4.1.1.3 Verification Survey

Verification surveys are conducted to check the validity of pre-existing full (or combination of full and partial)
surveys when no changes to the vessel’s configuration have occurred. This is the minimum survey required
as part of Annual Systems Preparation and, as such, shall be conducted at least annually. The purposes of a
verification survey are to review the offsets, error estimates, and documentation of the prior survey, and to check
for measurement blunders, vector algebra mistakes, sign errors, etc.

Verification surveys can be viewed as a “sanity check” of the existing survey data and may be conducted using
traditional methods. Typical procedures consist of pulling steel tape between benchmarks to verify the offset values
and rechecking the vector algebra to confirm established values. Error estimates in the original documentation
shall be reviewed for consistency and suitability for the vessel’s current mission. Any discrepancies discovered
during a verification survey may trigger a partial survey or a new full survey of the vessel.


#### 1.4.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Periodic quality assurance checks are simply Verification Surveys, or portions thereof, performed at the discretion
of the field unit. This type of check would be used if the vessel was involved in an incident, such as a grounding,
that might have altered the positions of benchmarks and instrumentation, affecting the validity of the annual
survey. If changes are found, a partial survey or new full survey of the vessel may be necessary.

#### 1.4.1.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements

The documentation required for vessel static offset surveys varies with the extent of the survey conducted.
Documentation, as defined below, for static offset surveys shall be maintained by the field unit and available
for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of documentation for
all full and partial surveys shall be transmitted to HSTP. The dates, basic methodology used, and responsible
professional survey agency (if applicable) for vessel static offset surveys shall be entered in the Hydrographic
Systems Inventory. Any interim survey performed as a quality assurance check shall be described in the DAPR
for all associated projects.


*Page 8*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



##### 1.4.1.3.1 Full and Partial Surveys

Documentation for full and partial vessel offset surveys shall include the following:
•	 A full description of the equipment and technique employed, including diagrams showing the positions of
setups and any pertinent technical data available for the instruments used for the survey. The survey location
and description of how the vessel was leveled and immobilized, if applicable, should also be provided.
•	 Pictures and/or diagrams showing the general arrangement of the surveyed vessel and identifying the positions
of benchmarks and instruments.

•	 An error analysis describing how the error values for each measurement were determined.

•	 Raw measurement data and a table of final results (including error estimates). A reviewer should be able to
easily reconstruct the steps of data reduction from the information provided.

•	 A copy of Vessel Reports, generated in CARIS HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor, for each resulting CARIS HIPS
Vessel File (HVF).


##### 1.4.1.3.2 Verification Surveys

Documentation for verification of an existing full (or combination of full and partial) vessel offset survey shall
include the following:
•	 A simple description of the equipment and techniques used for measurements.

•	 A reference to the full survey or combination of full and partial surveys that were verified.

•	 A copy of Vessel Reports, generated in CARIS HIPS and SIPS Vessel Editor, for each HVF which will remain
in effect.

•	 Notation of any discrepancies discovered in the prior survey(s) and how these items were resolved.

### 1.4.2 Vessel Dynamic Offsets

Dynamic offsets are those parameters of a vessel that are expected to change over relatively short time periods. The
primary dynamic offset is vessel draft. A hydrographic survey vessel’s draft and, therefore, the vertical position of
the sonar transducer within the water column is affected by many factors, including the vessel’s loading, weight
distribution, and speed through the water. When addressed as one vessel characteristic, these effects are referred
to as “Dynamic Draft.” Dynamic draft is the sum of “Static Draft” and “Settlement and Squat”.

Static draft is the draft of the vessel at rest, fully loaded and outfitted for surveying. This value can be affected by
the amount of equipment, fuel, personnel, and other gear loaded on the vessel, and is also a function of the density
of the water in which the vessel is operating.

“Settlement” is the purely vertical component of this vessel characteristic and is measured at the vessel’s
approximate center of motion. Although this vertical displacement is in the same direction as heave, settlement is
usually filtered out of recorded heave data because its frequency is much lower than the cutoff frequency of high

*Page 9*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


pass filters typically associated with heave measurement devices. As a result, settlement must be measured and
corrected for independently of heave action.

”Squat” refers to the tendency of a vessel’s stern to sink into the water as speed increases while operating in
displacement mode (i.e., not on a plane). Squat typically results in a bow-up attitude, although a reverse effect may
actually take place at higher speeds for some hull designs. Since echosounders are generally not mounted directly
at a vessel’s center of motion, squat acts on a lever arm from the center of motion to the echosounder, causing a
vertical displacement of the transducer. On vessels equipped with attitude sensors, this effect is addressed as a
part of attitude measurements and corrections. For vessels without attitude sensors, squat must be measured and
corrected for as a part of dynamic draft.


#### 1.4.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods


##### 1.4.2.1.1 Static Draft

As part of Annual Systems Preparation, static draft shall be measured across the anticipated range of loading and
buoyancy conditions. At a minimum, field units should track changes in static draft for a sufficient period of time
to develop a statistically significant sample of values from which an error estimate can be produced. Depending
on these results and the requirements of the survey, the frequency of draft measurements and updates of the HVF
necessary during survey operations will vary. On some vessels, it may be necessary to measure static draft as often
as twice a day, while annual measurements may be sufficient for others.

Factors influencing the frequency of static draft measurement include the following:
•	 Survey Accuracy Required - If the error associated with static draft measurement is determined to be acceptable
for meeting survey accuracy requirements, a single static draft value may be sufficient. This value should be
the mean of multiple observations taken over a wide range of loading and buoyancy conditions for the vessel.
If survey accuracy requirements increase, more frequent static draft measurements may be necessary.
•	 Loading Conditions - Vessels with a wide range of loading configurations will require more frequent static
draft measurements than vessels with minimal loading changes. For example, many NOAA ships conduct
survey operations both with and without launches in the davits, which can create a significant difference in
vessel draft. Likewise, a hydrographic survey launch’s static draft may vary noticeably with the amount of
fuel loaded and the number of personnel embarked.

•	 Buoyancy - A vessel’s static draft will vary with the density of the water in which it floats. If the vessel will
be operating in waters with a wide range of densities (most strongly influenced by salinity), more frequent
observation of static draft may be necessary. Additionally, water density may change significantly with project
area, making static draft determined at one location inappropriate for survey operations in another area.

###### 1.4.2.1.1.1 Static Draft Measurement Techniques

The technique chosen to measure static draft may be influenced by the anticipated frequency of measurement
required. Examples of measurement techniques include the following: Draft Marks on Hull - During the static
offset measurement survey (see section 1.4.1) the vessel’s hull can be marked with vertical elevation differences
from the Vessel Reference Point. If this method is used, the hull should be marked on both the port and starboard
sides, in the athwartships plane of the Vessel Reference Point. Static draft is then determined by averaging the port
and starboard readings. Sight Tube - A more precise method for measuring static draft is a clear plastic or glass

*Page 10*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


sight tube installed in the interior of the vessel. This method can be particularly useful on hydrographic survey
launches. The lower end of the tube is connected to a through-hull fitting below the waterline (with a valve at the
hull), and the top is either connected to a through-hull above the waterline or extends sufficiently high enough
above the waterline to prevent flooding. The clear portion of the sight tube, where measurements will be read,
should be installed directly over (or as close as possible to) the vessel RP and graduated for direct measurement of
the waterline offset from the reference point. Note: The static draft information is to be placed in the ’waterline’
entry in the CARIS HVF.


##### 1.4.2.1.2 Dynamic Draft

At a minimum, dynamic draft shall be measured during Annual Systems Preparation. Although dynamic draft is
a function of both hull shape and weight distribution, the influence of weight distribution is typically negligible.
Thus, dynamic draft can be measured annually with the vessel in an average loading configuration, and the
results combined with a range of static draft measurements for a final dynamic draft determination. Vessels with
ancillary trim capabilities (e.g., trim tabs, jet drives, and outboard motors) should establish operating procedures
to standardize vessel trim during survey operations.


###### 1.4.2.1.2.1 Dynamic Draft Measurement Techniques

Settlement and squat are actually two separate parameters, but they can be easily measured together. If possible,
this measurement should be accomplished in a body of water at least 7 times the vessel draft, where water level
,current effects, and wave conditions will be minimal for the period of the calibration. There are three common
methods of determining dynamic draft values. Each method is described below.

Optical Level
This technique uses an optical level to site the height of the vessel moving at different speeds through the water,
relative to a fixed position ashore. The basic procedures are as follows:
•	 Set Up - Set up an optical level on shore near a channel or fairway where the vessel will be free to maneuver.
The closer the level station is to where the vessel will traverse, the more accurate the readings will be. A pier
is a valid location for the level station, but the pier must be a stable structure that does not exhibit significant
movement over time. Level rods should be positioned on the port and starboard sides of the vessel. If the vessel
to be calibrated is equipped with an attitude sensor, the level rods should be positioned in the athwartships
plane of the vessel’s approximate center of motion so that only settlement is measured (squat will be measured
and corrected in conjunction with vessel attitude). If the vessel does not have an attitude sensor, the level rods
should be located in the athwartships plane of the sonar transducer, which will combine squat effects in the
measurement.

•	 Data Acquisition - Run the vessel in opposing directions (either perpendicular to or parallel with the level
station line of sight) at various speeds, ranging from dead slow ahead to slightly faster than the maximum
anticipated survey speed. On each run, the vessel must be allowed sufficient time to stabilize in attitude and
speed prior to the measurement point. For each speed, a rod measurement should be taken on each side of
the vessel. The port and starboard values for each speed are averaged to cancel the effect of any current or
vessel list. Before and after each pair of runs, the elevation values for the vessel at rest should be measured
in order to correct for any change in water levels over the course of the test. The data should be recorded in
tabular format, with the final dynamic draft value for each speed being the difference between the average at
rest readings (before and after each pair of runs) and the average of the port and starboard underway readings.

Post-Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS
*Note: The technique and analysis use depends greatly on the vessel and the area in which you are working. If
you have any questions, contact your HSTP representative before proceeding.

This technique uses the vessel’s POS/MV system and POSPac data acquisition and processing to measure vessel
ellipsoid heights at speeds relevant to survey operations. A polynomial regression of the changes in height is used
to formulate a dynamic draft table with associated uncertainties. The Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft.
py may be used for the dynamic draft table data analysis. This macro reads POSPac Smoothed Best Estimate
Trajectory (SBET) dynamic draft calibration data, (optionally) adjusts for tidal water levels, and outputs graphs
and tables per a 3rd or 4th-order polynomial regression. The basic procedures are as follows:
•	

Assumptions
•	
	
	
	
	

If the dynamic draft calibration test is performed in a tidally-active area, plan on performing the data 		
analysis using the Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py (see below). This macro includes the ability 	
to compensate for both discrete-zoned and TCARI water levels. Other data analysis may be used at the 		
discretion of the field unit. A spreadsheet analysis may be used, particularly in areas with negligible 		
tides, or during a time when water level changes due to tide will be negligible.


•	 Wave conditions need to be minimal as with all dynamic draft measurements.

•	
	
	
	

It is also assumed that the ellipsoid is relatively parallel to the water level over the area of this test. 		
Time periods of static vessel heights at the end of each line will help to confirm this assumption. If 		
there is evidence to the contrary once data has been acquired, another area may need to be selecte 		
or another technique may need to be used for dynamic draft measurements.


Data Acquisition - Select an area where the water depth is sufficient to remove the strong effects of squat due to
shallow water. The area should be large enough that you can acquire data between 2-5 minutes at speed, enough
time to allow the vessel to settle out at speed. Start acquiring POSPac data at least 5 minutes before beginning
the test. While consecutive changes in speed can be used, a one to two minute “rest period” between each speed
change is recommended to capture offsets due to tides, currents or geoid shape. An adequate rest period length
is a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the particular vessel; i.e., how long it takes for the given
vessel to stablize to “static” conditions. Run lines in opposing directions taking into account current magnitudes
and directions; data sampling should be balanced between lines progressing with and stemming the current.
It is important to acquire lines at regular speed intervals over a range that is relevant to the multibeam survey
work of the vessel;e.g., from barely maintaining steerage through 10+ knots, at an interval of 2 knots. Do NOT
stop recording POSPac between lines; PPK processing performs best using uninterupted sessions of GPS data.
Record the order in which you ran the speeds and what direction you went between each of the rest periods.
A complete written record of the dynamic draft calibration fieldwork may prove invaluable in troubleshooting
peculiar looking results later.



*Page 12*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 Data Processing - Data is processed in Applanix’s POSPac software through either a SmartBase solution
or a SingleBase solution. POSPac data can be processed referencing the rapid ephemeris solutions. Final
ephemeris data can take up to 2 weeks to become available, and does not signifigantly change the calculated
values. The data are processed through the GNSS-Inertial Processor in the Forwards, Backwards and Combine
mode with the Roll, Pitch and Heading Initialization set to Initialize from the real time solution and the Lever
Arm Standard Deviation ideally known to 3cm or better (The lever arm standard deviation should be set based
on how well you actually know your lever arms). SBETs may be decimated to 1Hz to alleviate the processing
load in Data Analysis, without any detrimental effects. Control station auto-adjust should never be used for
processing SBETs.

•	

Data Analysis - A time series of both speed and ellipsoid heights, as well as a plot of speed versus ellipsoid
heights should be examined to ensure data quality and to look for offsets. A polynomial least squares fit
regression on speed versus ellipsoid height is completed with user preferred software. A minimum of a third
order regression should be used. A comparison between the regression and the plotted data should be completed
both through a raw plot with regression curve and through the ellipsoid height minus regression residuals.
Changes in the ellipsoid height not captured by the curve should be noted and changes to the regression
process may be needed. Take special care to note the zero speed crossing, as it can result in vertical offsets in
the dynamic draft table. Careful examination here cannot be emphasized enough.


Once a satisfactory curve is obtained, a dynamic draft table can be created between regular speed increments and
the corresponding height from the regression equation subtracting the zero speed ellipsoid height constant. Since
the table for CARIS HIPS is a correction file, increases in draft with speed result in positive values in the HIPS
table. Uncertainty in the dynamic draft table is obtained by calculating two standard deviations of the residual
data to regression difference. If uncertainty for each speed is desired the residuals can be binned by speed and the
standard deviation calculated for each bin. Care should be taken that sufficient data exists in each bin.
As mentioned previously, all of the required data analysis, from SBET to dynamic draft table–including tide
compensation, can be achieved via the Pydro macro ProcSBETDynamicDraft.py. Complete details about using
this macro may be found in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.

Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS
Procedures are currently being developed for a real-time kinematic GPS determination of dynamic draft. These
methods have not yet been approved by OCS and shall not be used for Annual Systems Preparation.

Echosounder
This technique uses a vessel’s MBES system to determine dynamic draft. A detailed procedure
is described below.

•	 Data Acquisition -Data should be acquired in an area with a flat seafloor and relatively shallow water. Water
depth should also be at least seven times the vessel draft to reduce attitude bias. The geographical location
should be as close as possible to a water level station. If the survey time is planned to minimize currents,
adequate data can typically be acquired by running in one common direction for all vessel speeds. If currents
are significant, it will be necessary to acquire data in opposing directions for each speed and average thetwo
values. As with the optical level method, vessel attitude and speed must be stable while acquiring data.
•	 Line Acquisition -Plan a survey line approximately 1000 meters in length. Establish a center reference point
for three approximately 20m2 reference areas located at distances of ¼, ½, and ¾ along the line as shown in
Figure 1.1. Acquire data along the line at various RPM intervals, ranging from the minimum to the maximum

*Page 13*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


speed anticipated for survey operations. Minimize across-track error during line navigation and establish a
constant speed and heading prior to logging data. Monitor and minimize induced heave during data acquisition.
Run the line in coincidental directions for redundancy. To minimize induced heave, allow time for the IMU to
stabilize before reacquiring data.


Figure 1.1: Recommended line plan for determining dynamic draft using a vessel’s echosounder.

•	 Reference Area Acquisition - At each reference area, acquire data along the line at the lowest speed possible
while maintaining heading and stable attitude to create a baseline with negligible dynamic draft. It is
recommended that reference area data be acquired both before and after line acquisition to bracket and evaluate
any significant water level variation. Compare these zero or at-rest settlement and squat measurements with
each of the at-speed measurements to determine offsets caused by speed variation. If the seafloor is not flat,
several passes may be required at each reference area to create an accurate reference surface. Conduct a sound
velocity cast near the center reference point. The reference area acquisition is considered the "At rest" depth
and should be the baseline to which you compare the depths acquired at speed.

•	 If there is concern for induced draft while moving over the targets, an alternative reference surface calculation
can be made utilizing Drift Line Measurement: If the reference or drift line is run perpendicular to the analysis
line it will produce a swath sufficient enough for data acquisition. If you are conducting this dynamic draft test
on a vessel with a 1.5 meter draft your test should be performed in at least 10.5 meters (35 feet) of water. At
that water depth the average swath width would be 36.75 meters (122.5 feet).

•	 Processing Soundings - If the echosounder system used for data acquisition performs real-time heave filtering,
convert the data without applying true heave. Long-period heave will bias dynamic draft calculations. Random,
short-period heave should cancel out during statistical averaging of reference surface depths. Filter soundings
to reject all but those with the highest data quality flag.

•	 A surface should contain only the drift line or reference area lines.

•	 Separate surfaces should be made at each rpm interval (i.e. if lines were run at 600, 800, and 1000 rpm, 	
	 create a grid for each of the 600, 800, and 1000 rpm drift lines).

•	 Sample all line surfaces and the reference surface soundings using an approximately 3 m x 20 m subset area
at each of the three reference areas. Minimally clean subsets for gross fliers and noise. Select and query all
soundings from each subset dataset and save each CARIS query window as a text file. This can be done by
simply copying and pasting directly into a MS Excel spreadsheet. Import these text files into MS Excel as tabdelimited records. Sort these Excel data by line ID and calculate the median surface depth (use =MEDIAN
(c#:c#) ) for each speed level at each reference area. Typical sample populations should be between 3,000 –
5,000 soundings (use =COUNTA (c#:c#) to check).


*Page 14*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 The reference surface should be sampled first to be used as the control in the data analysis.
•	 Coincidental lines should be sampled together in the same surface.

•	

Navigation/Speed - Using the CARIS Navigation Editor, query position fixes for individual lines within each
reference area subset. Save each query as a text file and import these data into Excel as tab-delimited records.
Calculate the average speed for each RPM in each of the reference areas (use =average (c#:c#).


•	 Offset Tables - For each reference area, subtract the median reference area depth from median depths for
each RPM/speed interval to calculate relative dynamic draft offsets. Plot Speed vs. Offset for each of the
3 reference areas to evaluate data consistency. Average data from the ¼, ½ and ¾ point reference areas to
calculate final dynamic draft values.

•	 Error Analysis -The standard deviation of each speed correction should be calculated by comparing the values
derived from each surface area. The largest standard deviation value should be entered into the vessel’s HVF
for dynamic draft error. Note that in CARIS, the squat and settlement is entered in as “delta draft” or the
positive change in draft as the draft increases and negative as the draft decreases.


#### 1.4.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Static draft shall be re-measured at whatever frequency determined necessary to meet survey specifications.
However, at a minimum, static draft should be checked against previous survey values at the start of a new project
and whenever a vessel will be conducting survey operations with an atypical loading configuration. Dynamic draft
shall be re-measured if the vessel’s hull shape is altered, significant changes in weight distribution of the vessel
have been made, or other physical alterations have been made to the vessel that may affect dynamic draft values.

#### 1.4.2.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Dynamic offset measurement documentation shall be broken into two separate sections, one for static draft and one
for dynamic draft measurements. All information listed below should be documented. This documentation shall
be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request
of OCS. The dates and basic methodology used to determine dynamic offset measurements shall be reported in
the DAPR for each applicable project. The actual frequency of static draft measurements, any significant changes
to static draft, and any subsequent changes to dynamic draft should also be included with this documentation.
Static draft measurement documentation shall include the following:
•	 A complete description of the procedure used to determine draft and estimate error.

•	 Geographical location where measurements were made and number of observations used for draft determination.
•	 Raw draft measurement data in tabular format and error estimate calculations.

•	 Final static draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.

•	 The frequency with which draft will be measured during subsequent survey operations, with justification for
this decision.


*Page 15*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dynamic draft measurement documentation shall include the following:
•	 A complete description of the procedure used to determine dynamic draft, with a chartlet identifying the
geographical area where measurements were made.

•	 Raw data with sufficient explanation of data reduction to enable recalculation of the final dynamic draft values
and error estimates.

•	 Final dynamic draft values, as applied in the CARIS HVF.

Note: Think carefully about the sign of the dynamic draft values placed in the Draft sensor entry in the CARIS
HVF. CARIS expects the change in Z to be a positive down, so a sinking of transducer creates a shallower depth
than the “true depth”, and the dynamic draft value will be positive. If the vessel rises in the water, the measured
depth will be deeper than the “true depth” and the dynamic draft value will be negative. Depth= Observed depth
– Waterline + change in depth.


### 1.4.3 Wiring diagrams

All field units should maintain up-to-date wiring diagrams for each of their survey vessels. These wiring diagrams
should be reviewed and updated during the Annual Systems Preparation process.



1.5 Hardware Systems
---------------------

Hardware systems used by NOAA field units for hydrographic survey operations consist of a variety of
technologically advanced echosounders and attitude sensors and each instrument must be properly maintained
and calibrated in order to provide quality data.

Calibration, maintenance, documentation, and reporting requirements established by OCS for common hardware
systems used by NOAA hydrographic field units are described in sections 1.5.1 	 . New sensors and instruments
unique to only one or two field units may not be addressed in this manual. Likewise, as NOAA’s organizational
expertise with existing systems continues to grow, new and improved procedures that supersede those documented
here will be developed. In such cases, this section of the FPM shall be used as a guide for the development,
implementation, and documentation of new procedures. If a new procedure is used, it must be approved by HSTP
and documented with sufficient detail for the process to be recreated.


### 1.5.1 Position, Attitude, and Heading Sensors

For OCS hydrographic surveys, vessel position is typically determined using a variety of GPS based positioning
methods, as described in the Hydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables (HSSD). Attitude sensors are
often employed to measure a vessel’s roll and pitch about its RP and any purely vertical heave action affecting
the vessel. The vessel’s orientation about its vertical axis (i.e., yaw) is generally determined with a heading sensor
or gyroscopic compass. Attitude and heading values measured by these sensors are typically applied to sounding
data during post-processing. Each of the aforementioned sensors may be stand-alone systems, or they may be
integrated into a navigation system that will collectively determine vessel position, attitude, and heading.


*Page 16*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: Not all NOAA hydrographic field units may be outfitted with an attitude sensor. However, this equipment
will be included on any NOAA vessel used to acquire multibeam echosounder data. Vessel attitude must be
measured and applied to multibeam data to produce accurate soundings. Due to the wide beam angle of vertical
beam echosounders (VBES), attitude corrections are less critical for this type of data. However, CARIS HIPS is
capable of applying attitude data to VBES when available.

The Applanix POS/MV (Position and Orientation System/Marine Vessel), a GPS-aided inertial navigation system,
is the most common system used by NOAA hydrographic field units to measure vessel position, attitude, and
heading. As such, the POS/MV calibration and reporting requirements are specifically addressed in this manual.
Field units equipped with alternate position, attitude, or heading sensors shall contact the regional HSTP Field
Support Liaison to develop approved calibration and maintenance requirements.


#### 1.5.1.1 Applanix POS/MV

The POS/MV navigation system will calculate survey-quality vessel position, heading, and attitude data. Primary
system components consist of a processing unit, two GPS antennas, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU),
which is typically installed at the vessel’s RP for NOAA configurations.


##### 1.5.1.1.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

At a minimum, NOAA hydrographic field units shall calibrate the POS/MV during Annual Systems Preparation.
Additionally, the POS/MV shall be recalibrated after any IMU or antenna installations, movements, and/or
modifications. The appropriate POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide will contain comprehensive guidance
on system operation and calibration.

Note: Although the POS/MV Installation and Operation Guide refers to the calibration process as “antenna
installation calibration,” it should be performed following any physical antenna or IMU adjustments, not just
antenna installation. Additionally, all IMUs shall be turned in to the regional Electronics and Engineering Division
(EED) depot every three years so that the units can be shipped to Applanix for factory service and recertification.
If a field unit has been equipped with a Version 4 or higher POS/MV system, it is possible to perform an additional
lever-arm calibration. However, this calibration should not be attempted without appropriate Real Time Kinematic
(RTK) support. Field units should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for RTK support prior to
conducting a lever-arm calibration.


###### 1.5.1.1.1.1 Offsets & Reference Frame Conventions

Prior to calibration, POS/MV lever arm distances should be entered, as necessary, and/or verified in the POS/
MV controller software. Be very careful not to enter values for offsets that will be applied to data during postprocessing via the HVF. If the IMU is collocated with the vessel’s RP and CM, the distance from the IMU to the
primary GPS antenna (port side for OCS configurations) and the distance between GPS antennas may be the only
offsets that need to be entered in the POS/MV controller software. Measured antenna separation distance must be
accurate to within 5 mm, per the manufacturer’s specifications. Refer to the POS/MV Installation and Operation
Guide for additional measurement accuracy requirements and coordinate system conventions. Note: Be certain
that offsets entered in the POS/MV controller software correspond to the local POS/MV coordinate system, which
may differ from the vessel reference frame coordinate system. A summary of coordinate systems for common
OCS systems and software is included in Appendix 1 (Coordinate_Systems.pdf).


*Page 17*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



###### 1.5.1.1.1.2 Performing the Calibration

Detailed instructions for performing a POS/MV calibration should be reviewed in the POS/MV Installation and
Operation Guide. For a successful calibration, the POS/MV GPS Azimuth Measurement Subsystem (GAMS)
must have data available from 7 or more satellites and a Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) equal to or less
than 3.0. The calibration should be performed at a time when satellite geometry is good. GPS mission planning
software can be used to identify an optimal calibration time, during which the PDOP will be at a minimum.
Mission planning software is included on the Hydrosoft website https://inside.nos.noaa.gov/hydrosoft/welcome.
html, or at no charge from Trimble at www.trimble.com/planningsoftware.html.

The POS/MV calibration should be performed in an open area where unrestricted maneuvering is possible and
there are few vertical features likely to produce multipath signals. Set the user multipath setting to “Low” to allow
the system to calibrate with the highest accuracy. It is important for heading accuracy to settle to less than the
threshold set under the GAMS Installation Parameters before performing a calibration.

Note: This threshold shall always be set to 0.5 degrees or less when calibrating systems for OCS survey operations.
Maneuvering the vessel in a figure eight pattern will help bring the heading accuracy within this range. Once
a calibration is started, it often takes more than the 1-2 minutes on a straight course stated in the POS/MV
Installation and Operation Guide for the “CAL in Progress” process to complete. After a successful calibration,
save the new calibration values into non-volatile memory as described in the POS/MV Installation and Operation
Guide, and save a copy of the final POS/MV configuration file for reference. A method for computing the lever
arm offsets is outlined in the Ellipsoidally Referenced Survey SOP.pdf in Appendix 4.


##### 1.5.1.1.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Once a high-quality POS/MV calibration has been performed, it should remain valid until system components
are moved or altered. The POS/MV should operate reliably provided adequate satellite coverage and differential
correctors are available. If the POS/MV becomes problematic, recalibration may be conducted at the discretion
of the field unit. If a recalibration is desired, the same process used for the annual calibration should be repeated.
Note: If the POS/MV is recalibrated, a new patch test should be performed for any associated multibeam
echosounder systems. (Refer to section 1.5.5.1.2 for a description of the patch test).

For each calibration conducted, system settings, procedures, and results achieved should be recorded in a POS/
MV Calibration Report. A blank report form is included in Appendix 1 (POS-MV_Cal_Report.pdf), with sample
data entered in red font. This documentation shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during
Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. The dates of current POS/MV calibrations shall be
reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. All POS/MV calibrations conducted shall be described in the
DAPR for each applicable project.


### 1.5.2 Sound Speed Measurement Instruments

Accurate measurements of sound speed (often referred to as “sound velocity”) both through the water column
and at the water’s surface are critical to hydrography, particularly if soundings are acquired using a multibeam
echosounder. Two basic types of sound speed instruments are currently used by NOAA hydrographic field units,
those which directly measure sound speed (commonly referred to as “velocimeters”) and those which measure
conductivity, temperature and depth and then calculate sound speed (commonly referred to as “CTDs”). All field
units performing OCS surveys shall proactively monitor the accuracy of sound speed measuring instruments and
conduct preventative maintenance as described below.


*Page 18*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#### 1.5.2.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

All sound speed measuring instruments employed by NOAA hydrographic field units shall be calibrated annually
and inspected by the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer recommends a different time period. Field units
should turn in all sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED depot promptly after arriving for winter
inport or during another suitable period of inactivity. EED will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the
manufacturer for calibration and inspection. This process takes approximately six weeks.

Note: For DigibarPro systems, only the probe needs to be returned for annual calibration. There is no need to
remove the cable or display unit from the vessel unless these components require repair or replacement. Field units
that can not feasibly submit sound speed measuring instruments to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to
coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer. Following annual calibrations, comparisons equivalent to the
Data Quality Assurance processes described in section 1.5.2.2 shall be conducted for all sound speed measuring
instruments.


#### 1.5.2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Periodic quality assurance checks shall be performed for all sound speed measuring instruments. NOAA
hydrographic platforms shall conduct these quality assurance checks on a daily or weekly basis as described
below. Field units with sound speed measurement instruments not addressed in this manual should contact the
regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to develop a comparable quality assurance plan.


##### 1.5.2.2.1 Daily Data Quality Assurance (Daily DQA)

If the vessel is equipped with a surface sound speed measuring instrument (typically installed at the head of
a multibeam sonar), compare a measurement from this instrument to the results of a full sound speed profile
acquired at the beginning of each day the surface instrument will be used. This comparison can be performed in
NOAA’s Velocipy software, which is a second generation of the Velocwin, using the “Surface Sound Speed DQA”
function. All discrepancies greater than 1 m/s should be noted and tracked to determine if the instrument requires
repairs or recalibration. Note: NOAA hydrographic field units have experienced several failures with this type
of instrument. Since surface sound speed data is critical for acquiring data with flat-faced MBES systems, these
instruments must be monitored and tested each day prior to operations.


##### 1.5.2.2.2 Regular Data Quality Assurance (Regular DQA)

A full water column profile from each sound speed profiling instrument shall be compared to an independent source
at least once during each leg of survey operations or every two weeks during survey operations This comparison
should be accomplished by conducting a simultaneous cast with two profiling instruments and comparing the
results using Velocipy’s “Compare Two Profiles” function. Caution: If simultaneous casts are processed in
Velocipy using the same vessel name, the processed file names will be identical and one will be overwritten.
The user should rename the first file processed to avoid this potential problem. Data from two different types
of profilers can be used for this comparison, provided both datasets have been initially processed in Velocipy.
Comparison casts should be conducted in water at least as deep as typical depths for the current project.
Note: If a Digibar is to be used for a simultaneous cast, first conduct a Velocipy “Digibar DQA” comparison for
the instrument using a fresh water sample.


*Page 19*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#### 1.5.2.3 General Maintenance Practices

Velocimeters and CTDs should be rinsed with freshwater at the end of the day after use. The moving parts of the
winch on the Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) system requires weekly lubrication of its moving parts (e.g. gears
and levelwind) to maintain effectiveness and to sustain its lifetime. It is also highly recommended to shift the
messenger on the MVP every 24 hours of continuous use however armoring may make this more tedious. Field
units should routinely do an inspection of the MVP towfish.


#### 1.5.2.4 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Results from annual sound speed instrument calibrations, i.e., manufacturer’s documentation and the corresponding
digital calibration coefficient file, shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic
Systems Reviews or at the request of OCS. The dates of annual calibrations and any instrument problems or nonroutine maintenance performed shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory.
If using Velocipy, the results of each DQA test performed will be sorted by project number and saved to a file
named <project number>.DQA, (e.g., OPR-A###-AA-YY.DQA) in the “SVfiles” directory. If Velocipy is not
used for weekly data quality assessments, these comparisons shall be manually recorded. DQA records associated
with each survey shall be included in Separates II of the Descriptive Report. Documentation for all calibrations or
maintenance conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.


### 1.5.3 Manual Depth Measurement Equipment

Although no longer used as a primary means of survey, lead lines and sounding poles are invaluable for some
operations. These tools can be used to take soundings in areas too shallow for echosounders or to verify least
depths over dangers to navigation or shoals. The most common use of lead lines is as a calibration standard for
echosounders. However, like all measuring devices, these tools have their own calibration requirements. Both
lead line and sounding pole requirements are addressed in this section.


#### 1.5.3.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods


##### 1.5.3.1.1 Lead Lines

All field units engaged in hydrographic surveys where general depths are less than 40 meters shall carry one or
more marked and calibrated lead lines. Depending on the depths in which they will be used and the size of the
vessel, OCS recommends that lead lines are 30m to 60m long. Each lead line shall be marked with a numerical
identifier to be retained throughout the life of the lead line or until re-marking is necessary.

Traditional lead line material is mahogany-colored tiller rope with a phosphor-bronze wire center. Specifications
for this material and directions for making and maintaining a traditional lead line can be found in Appendix 1
(Leadline_Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since line and tape materials have evolved significantly and lead lines are
now used in special circumstances, rather than for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for alternate materials to
be used when constructing a lead line. When choosing a lead line material, key properties to be considered are
strength and elasticity. The line or tape must not part if deployed from a vessel underway and must not stretch
significantly under tension or when wet.


*Page 20*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


All lead lines used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated to at least the decimeter level. Any convenient
system of marking that will minimize reading errors may be used, provided each whole meter of line is marked
and identified with a clearly written numerical depth value.

Lead lines shall be calibrated by comparison with a known standard during Annual Systems Preparation and prior
to each day’s use if constructed with non-traditional material. The testing standard should be a survey quality
metal tape, pre-measured graduation marks on deck or ashore, or similar item. If the mean correction exceeds
0.1m the lead line must be re-marked.


##### 1.5.3.1.2 Sounding Poles

When surveying in depths too shallow for an echosounder, it may be prudent to use a sounding pole if the area is
flat and the waters are protected. Sounding poles shall not be used in depths greater than 4 meters and are typically
not used in depths greater than 2 meters.

A traditional sounding pole is made from a meter length of 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) round lumber capped with a
weighted metal shoe at each end to hasten sinking. Shorter poles may be used, depending on the depth conditions.
Directions for making and maintaining a traditional sounding pole can be found in Appendix 1 (Leadline_
Sndngpole_Directions.pdf). Since modern pole, pipe, and stick materials are readily available and sounding poles
are now used in special circumstances, rather than for entire surveys, it may be appropriate for alternate materials
to be used when constructing a sounding pole. When choosing a sounding pole material, key properties to be
considered are strength, weight, and bluntness. The pole must not significantly bend if deployed from a vessel
underway or weaken when wet. Additionally, it must not be so buoyant or sink so rapidly that it becomes difficult
to handle and must not penetrate the seafloor to an extent that would generate erroneous soundings.
All sounding poles used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be graduated in meters to at least the decimeter level.
Any convenient system of marking that will minimize reading errors may be used.

Any sounding pole maintained aboard a NOAA hydrographic vessel shall be calibrated during Annual Systems
Preparation. Calibration shall be against a known standard, such as a survey quality metal tape, to ensure that
depth markings are unambiguous and accurate. Sounding poles created between Annual Systems Preparation
events shall be calibrated prior to use on an OCS hydrographic survey.


#### 1.5.3.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Due to the static nature and infrequent use of manual depth measurement equipment, there are no requirements for
accuracy checks, other than annual calibrations, if traditional lead lines or a regularly maintained sounding pole
is being used. As previously stated, lead lines constructed with non-traditional material shall be calibrated prior
to each day’s use, and sounding poles created on-the-fly for special circumstances encountered shall be calibrated
prior to use on any OCS hydrographic survey.


#### 1.5.3.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

A Lead Line and Sounding Pole Calibration Report shall be completed each time a lead line or sounding pole
is made or compared to a standard. A report form is provided in Appendix 1 (Leadline_SndngPole_Cal_Report.
pdf), with sample data in red font. Reports for calibrations conducted during Annual Systems Preparation shall be
maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of

*Page 21*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OCS. The dates of current calibrations shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Documentation
for calibrations shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.

In addition to the above reporting requirements, a full Sounding System Comparison shall be completed each
year as a part of Annual Systems Preparation, following calibration of all sounding systems. A lead line shall
be used to manually acquire a standard for comparison to calculated depths from each of the field unit’s vertical
beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and diver least depth gauges. This process shall be documented
according to the example provided in Appendix 1 (Sndng_Sys_Comparison_Log.pdf) and included in the DAPR
for each applicable project.


### 1.5.4 Vertical Beam Echosounder (VBES) Systems

NOAA hydrographic field units may use VBES systems for water depth measurement and/or to confirm depths
measured by other systems, such as multibeam echosounders. The consistency and accuracy of VBES soundings
are directly related to the care with which these instruments are calibrated, maintained, and operated. It is critical
that field units both ensure these systems are properly calibrated and educate operators about the effects of
manually adjusting the transceiver controls such as power, gain, and sensitivity.

Vertical beam echosounders are typically either dual frequency or single frequency. Users should operate each
echosounder in accordance with its manufacturer’s documentation. When used for OCS hydrographic surveys,
VBES systems shall be set with an assumed speed of sound through water of 1500 m/s. Recorded sounding data
shall be corrected for actual sound speed, determined with a sound speed profiling instrument, during data postprocessing.

#### 1.5.4.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

The field unit shall verify, during Annual Systems Preparation, that VBES sounding data are accurate and that each
system is in proper working order. While a lead line comparison is the minimum VBES calibration requirement, a
simultaneous comparison of lead line, VBES, multibeam echosounder, and diver least depth gauge (DLDG) data
is also required by OCS during Annual Systems Preparation. (Refer to section 1.5.3.3 for details on Sounding
System Comparison.) If the VBES unit is found to be out of calibration, it should be sent to the regional EED
depot, which will return it to the manufacturer for repair. Field units that can not feasibly submit VBES systems
to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct submission to the manufacturer.
When performing sounding system comparisons, the vessel should, ideally, be anchored in an area with a flat
sandy bottom and calm sea conditions. If comparisons will also be made to DLDG data, the water depth should
be between 10 and 20 meters. The lead line depth should be measured from a location close to the transducer
and timed as near as possible to slack water to minimize any effect from current on the lead line. If the vessel
has a known list or is large enough that a level platform can not be accurately determined, simultaneous lead line
readings should be taken from each side of the vessel and averaged.


###### 1.5.4.1.0.1 HYPACK Latency Test

The following HYPACK latency test procedures should be performed for vessels operating a single beam
echosounder and no POS/MV or motion compensator. This test is used to solve for the delay in time between the
GPS “time tag” and the HYPACK PC time stamp.

device parameters or it can be added to the navigation timing lever arm correction in the CARIS HVF file.
(*note only add the offset in once!)

#### 1.5.4.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

For modern digital VBES systems, instrument errors are generally small, fixed in magnitude, and independent
observed depths. However, to ensure that echosounders continue to operate properly, periodic confidence
checks should be conducted. A confidence check can be accomplished by comparing VBES soundings to lead
line readings, nadir multibeam echosounder depths, or DLDG data. As when performing a calibration, routine
comparisons should be conducted in an area with a relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions are
calm.

Confidence checks shall be conducted at least once per week for all surveys performed with VBES systems.
Any discrepancies identified between sounding systems that are greater than the allowable depth error for the
corresponding survey must be investigated to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.


#### 1.5.4.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Results of VBES calibrations and confidence checks shall be recorded in a Sounding System Comparison Log
to be maintained by the field unit. A comparison log is included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.

*Page 24*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


pdf) with sample data in red font. Calibration records for each VBES used for hydrographic surveying shall
be available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Sounding System
Comparison Logs shall be included in the DAPR for all applicable surveys.


### 1.5.5 Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) Systems

NOAA’s hydrographic survey units use MBES systems to acquire full- and partial- bottom bathymetric coverage
throughout a survey area, to determine least depths over critical items such as wrecks, obstructions, and dangersto-navigation, and for general object detection. Field personnel should refer to section 5.2 of the HSSD.
Proper calibration of MBES systems is critical for maintaining ahigh level of accuracy and meeting OCS
hydrographic survey specifications. Various models of swath-type multibeam sonars are used for NOAA
hydrographic survey operations. For the purposes of this document these MBES systems will be treated as
equivalent units unless otherwise specified.


#### 1.5.5.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

MBES performance is largely a function of the original system specifications. To ensure that MBES systems used
for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately, all systems should be maintained and serviced in accordance
with manufacturers specifications.


##### 1.5.5.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification

Offsets for MBES systems shall be measured and/or verified as part of the vessel static offsets survey described
in section 1.4.1. OCS typically uses two types of MBES configurations, hull-mounted and pole- or lever mounted.
Particular attention must be paid to the alignment of the sonar head with respect to the keel of the survey vessel,
as a very small alignment error can introduce significant positioning errors in the data.

In addition to the above alignment considerations, pole- and lever-mounted systems introduce another potential
source of positioning error. Since these systems are deployed and retrieved after each use, care must be taken to
insure that the sonar is both stabilized during use (via pins, guy wires, or the like) and that its deployed position
does not vary. Stabilizing mechanisms should be inspected regularly for wear, stretching or general deterioration
that could affect the sonar offsets or stability.


##### 1.5.5.1.2 MBES Calibration

As part of Annual Systems Preparation, field parties shall conduct a system calibration to quantify the accuracy,
precision, and alignment for each MBES system. At a minimum, the calibration shall include determination of
residual biases in roll, pitch, heading, and navigation timing error. This procedure, commonly referred to as a
“patch test”, is performed by acquiring data that will highlight only one bias parameter at a time. The patch test
should be conducted in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of the HSSD.

Generally two lines of data must be acquired to resolve each bias. Vessel speed, direction and/or seafloor slope
will be specified for each line. Figure 1.5 illustrates the most efficient line plan for conducting a patch test;
however, lines for each bias may be completed in separate areas if an ideal geographical location is unavailable.
Once patch test data has been acquired, system integration errors are determined by aligning slopes and targets
acquired from different directions and speeds.


*Page 25*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Figure 1.5: Most efficient line plan for MBES calibration testing
Once bias correctors are determined for a system, the appropriate values should be entered into the CARIS HVF
for the corresponding vessel. If problems become apparent in the data or any part of the echosounder system
configuration is changed or damaged, a new system calibration must be conducted.


#### 1.5.5.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

MBES confidence checks shall be performed in accordance with section 5.2.4.1 of the HSSD. Confidence checks
shall be performed at least once during each survey conducted by multiple vessels that acquire overlapping data.
Surveys conducted with only a single vessel, shall perform confidence checks at least once per week. A confidence
check can be accomplished by comparing nadir MBES values to lead line readings, VBES depths, or DLDG data.
These comparisons should be conducted in an area with a relatively flat and hard bottom, when sea conditions are
calm. Any discrepancies identified between sounding systems that are greater than the allowable depth error for
the corresponding survey must be investigated to determine if the equipment is in need of repairs.

#### 1.5.5.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Each patch test conducted shall be documented in a MBES Calibration Table. A copy of this table is provided
in Appendix 1 (MBES_Cal_Table.pdf) with sample data entered in red font. In addition to a MBES Calibration
Table, a chartlet showing the test area and line plan, with line numbers and headings clearly identified, shall be
created for each system tested. The exact format of these chartlets is left to the discretion of the hydrographer.
Calibration information shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic
Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Copies of patch test documentation shall be submitted with the
DAPR for each applicable project.

Results of each MBES confidence check shall be recorded in a Sounding System Comparison Log to be maintained
by the field unit. A comparison example is included in Appendix 1 (Snding_Sys_Comparison.pdf) with sample
data in red font. Sounding System Comparison Logs shall be included in DAPR for all applicable projects.


*Page 26*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### 1.5.6 Diver Least Depth Gauge (DLDG)

The DLDG is a portable, self-contained, diver-deployed instrument that measures pressure in absolute pounds per
square inch (PSIA). Least depth values are computed from the difference between surface pressure (pre-dive) and
the pressure observed by the diver at a feature’s least depth.


#### 1.5.6.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

Each DLDG used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be calibrated annually. These instruments should be
submitted to the regional EED depot promptly after arriving for winter inport or during another suitable period of
inactivity. EED will arrange for the instruments to be returned to the manufacturer for calibration and inspection.
Field units that cannot feasibly submit DLDGs to the regional EED depot shall contact EED to coordinate a direct
submission to the manufacturer.

Once the DLDG calibration report has been received, a copy must be forwarded to HSTP. HSTP personnel
will generate, and provide to the field unit, a digital corrector file that must be loaded into Velocipy software to
facilitate DLDG pressure data processing. After calibration, a Sounding System Comparison including depths
computed using the DLDG shall be performed and recorded according to the example provided in Appendix 1
(Sndng_Sys_Comparison.pdf).


#### 1.5.6.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Velocipy software includes a DLDG DQA utility, which compares the DLDG pressure measurement in air to
barometric pressure. This comparison routine should be performed daily to record a relationship between the
vessel’s barometer and the DLDG. The DLDG DQA should also be performed before and after each day’s dive
operations to provide a pre-dive and post-dive record. If inconsistencies between the barometer and calculated
DLDG pressure become apparent, the DLDG may require repair or recalibration. The DLDG DQA routine in
Velocipy generates a graphic display of the DLDG pressure with respect to acceptable error margins. The test
passes if the new DLDG data point (red dot) lies within the two dashed lines representing the acceptable error
boundaries. Prior Daily DQA results are also displayed on this graph for comparison. Each time a Daily DQA is
performed, the data are appended to a digital file DIVERDAILYDQA.DAT.


#### 1.5.6.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

The manufacturer’s DLDG calibration report, HSTP generated digital corrector file, and results of the post
calibration Sounding System Comparison shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during
annual Hydrographic Systems Review and at the request of OCS. The DAILYDQA.DAT file and reports for any
additional Sounding System Comparisons shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.

### 1.5.7 Side Scan Sonar (SSS) Systems

NOAA hydrographic survey units use side scan sonar systems for both object detection and object recognition.
Side scan sonar is typically used in conjunction with a VBES or MBES system to meet object detection coverage
specifications for OCS surveys. Any SSS system used for OCS hydrography must be capable of detecting an
object on the sea floor with minimum dimensions of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m, as stated in section 6.1.2.1 of the HSSD.

*Page 27*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OCS uses both hull mounted and towed SSS system configurations. Horizontal accuracy for SSS operations
will depend on the system configuration, investigation technique, water depth, and target density. However, the
position of targets identified with side scan imagery must be sufficiently accurate to relocate the item for least
depth and survey position determinations, usually via a MBES system. In general, side scan imagery should be
capable of positioning point features to an absolute accuracy of less than 10 meters. NOAA field units use various
models of side scan sonar for hydrographic survey operations. For the purposes of this document, these systems
will be treated as equivalent unless otherwise specified.


#### 1.5.7.1 Calibration Requirements and Methods

Side scan sonar object detection and classification performance is largely a function of the original system
specifications. To ensure that side scan sonar systems used for OCS surveys continue to perform adequately,
hydrographers shall return all side scan systems to the regional EED depot for annual inspection and maintenance.
If a towfish is equipped with a pressure sensor, this must be serviced and calibrated as part of the EED annual
maintenance. If a towfish has been equipped with a transponder for locating the system if lost, new lithium
batteries shall be installed and the system tested using an interrogator as part of annual maintenance.

##### 1.5.7.1.1 Offset Measurement and Verification

Side scan system offsets must be measured and/or verified prior to performing a calibration. Depending upon
whether the sonar configuration is hull-mounted or towed, requirements for offset measurements will vary. Offset
requirements for each type of configuration are described below.


###### 1.5.7.1.1.1 Hull-Mounted SSS Configuration

For hull-mounted configurations, the phase center of the side scan shall be precisely positioned during the vessel
static offsets survey. The phase center of the towfish is considered to be at the fore and aft midpoint of the
transducers and on the centerline in the athwartships and vertical axes.

When hull-mounting a SSS, particular attention must be paid to the alignment of the towfish with respect to the
keel of the survey vessel, as a very small alignment error can introduce significant positioning errors in the data.
For example, a heading alignment error of only 1° will add 1.75 m horizontal positioning error at the edge of the
swath on a 100-m range scale. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to measure alignment error with a yaw patch
test, and enter a correction in the HVF. The field unit should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for
assistance with this test, if needed.


###### 1.5.7.1.1.2 Towed SSS Configuration

For towed SSS operations, static vessel offsets should be measured to the towpoint. The actual towfish position
is typically calculated using towfish depth and cable out measurements. Towfish depth may be determined by a
depth sensor installed in the towfish or calculated by subtracting the towfish height (determined by a separate
echosounder installed in the towfish or the first return of each sonar ping) from the depth of water (determined
from a vessel echosounder). If a SSS is equipped with a pressure sensor, its accuracy should be tested annually
and whenever the horizontal positioning accuracy of side scan targets is in doubt. Cable out can be estimated
visually from calibrated markings on the cable or measured with an electronic cable counter. Each configuration
is described below.


*Page 28*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: When measuring cable out, the cable zero mark is not at its connection to the towfish, but at the phase
center of the sonar.

•	 Marked Cable - Marked tow cables shall be measured using a survey grade metal tape and clearly marked.
Cable markings shall be in meters and enable visual interpolation to a tenth of a meter. Since a cable jacketcan
stretch and slide over the conductors during use, cable measurement markings shall be verified annually, and
whenever the hydrographer believes they may be in error.

•	 Cable Counter - Electronic cable counters shall be configured according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The hydrographer shall verify the accuracy of the cable counter by comparing manual and electronic cable
measurements at a range of cable lengths. This check shall be conducted annually, whenever the counter,
cable, or sheave configuration is changed, and whenever the hydrographer believes there may be a cable
measurement error. Note: For some cable counters, the serial data output being logged may be in different
units than what is shown on the cable counter display. In such cases, the hydrographer may need to perform a
conversion on raw cable out data either prior to logging or during post-processing.


##### 1.5.7.1.2 SSS Calibration

As part of Annual Systems Preparation, the field unit shall demonstrate that all side scan sonar systems to be used
for OCS hydrographic surveys are capable of meeting object detection standards set forth in section 6.1.2 of the
HSSD. An operational SSS Calibration Test shall be conducted to demonstrate the system’s ability to detect and
accurately position seafloor targets across the system’s range on both sonar channels. Test information shall be
recorded in a SSS Calibration Table. An example of this table is provided in Appendix 1 (SSS_Cal_Table.pdf)
with sample data entered in red font.

The SSS Calibration test shall consist of a minimum of 10 side scan passes on a target approximately 1 m x 1 m
x 1 m. The target shall be imaged from a variety of ranges and directions, with survey speed, water depth, and
weather representative of typical survey conditions. Although dedicated test targets can be used for this check,
targets of opportunity, such as buoy blocks, lobster pots, and appropriately sized rocks, may be sufficient. The
hydrographer should use alternate systems (e.g., MBES) to determine a high accuracy absolute position of the
target for comparison with SSS detected positions.

Figure 1.6 shows the OCS recommended line plan for conducting a SSS Calibration Test. Note that this line plan
balances ensonifications on the port and starboard channels, across the range scale, from different target aspects,
and from different directions. This approach assists the hydrographer in differentiating systematic and random
errors in detection and positioning.


Figure 1.6: Recommended line plan for SSS calibration testing.


*Page 29*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Test data shall be processed according to standard OCS hydrographic survey procedures and evaluated to identify
any systematic problems with the sonar or vessel offsets. If the contact is not detected in more than one of the 10
passes, the SSS towfish should be carefully inspected for damage and the system re-tested. If detection remains
problematic, the field unit shall contact EED and the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison for guidance.
Successful object detections shall be used to compare the mean detected position with the absolute target position
and to compute the approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the system. This radius should not exceed 5 meters
for hull-mounted systems and 10 meters for towed systems. Several methods can be used to estimate the 95%
Confidence Radius. A simple option is to plot the detected target positions in MapInfo, and use the “Compute
Statistics” function to compute the sample standard deviation of the x and y components of the detection positions
(computing statistics of the Eastings and Northings yields values in meters). Assuming a normal distribution, 95%
of the samples will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. If the distribution of detections is similar in x
and y, the 95% Confidence Radius is roughly 1.96 times the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard
deviation of detected positions in x and y.

If the distributions in x and y are not similar, it is likely that a systematic bias exists that was not canceled by
ensonifying the target from multiple ranges and directions.

Similar results can be obtained by measuring the error for each detection (the distance from the absolute target
position to the detected position) and computing the sample mean and standard deviation of the errors. The
approximate 95% Confidence Radius is then the sample mean plus 1.96 times the standard deviation.

#### 1.5.7.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

At least one confidence check of a SSS system shall be conducted each day the system is used for data acquisition.
These checks should be in accordance with section 6.1.3.1 of the HSSD and consist of detecting a discrete
object at the outer range scale limits for each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard). Confidence checks shall be
annotated in the daily data acquisition records. If these confidence checks repeatedly show discrepancies with
expected performance, a new System Calibration may need to be performed.

Before surveying with a SSS system that has been either reconfigured or in storage, a “rub test” should be
performed. The rub test is a simple procedure wherein a hydrographer observes the SSS trace while an assistant
physically rubs one transducer on the towfish and then the other while the system is pinging. As the assistant rubs
the transducer, the hydrographer should see a return on the corresponding channel of the imagery. A rub test failure
can indicate system errors such as incorrect gain or power settings, a faulty cable, or damaged transducers. This
test should be conducted while the towfish is out of the water and dry, to avoid the possibility of electric shock.
Caution: Do not leave a SSS towfish turned on for more than 5 minutes while out of the water. These are watercooled systems and can be damaged by excessive heat buildup if left on when not deployed.

#### 1.5.7.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements

In addition to a SSS Calibration Table, a chartlet showing the test area, actual target position, test line plan, positions
of successful detections, and approximate 95% Confidence Radius for the target location shall be created for each
system tested. The exact format of these chartlets is left to the discretion of the hydrographer. This information
shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the
request of OCS. Documentation for SSS Calibration Tests conducted shall be included with the DAPR for each
associated project.


*Page 30*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There is no requirement to individually document and report SSS confidence checks required in section 1.5.7.2
above. Hydrographers shall verify that these checks were conducted, describe the results, and discuss any problems
encountered in the Quality Control section of each applicable Descriptive Report.


### 1.5.8 Tide Gauges

Tide gauges are used to measure water levels for calculating bathymetric data correctors. In any given tidal area,
water level data account for the largest vertical correction to soundings. However, water levels vary due to both
astronomical tides and effects from other forces such as wind, rain, barometric pressure, and freshwater runoff.
Even in areas where tidal range is small, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the total water level variations can still
be large enough to significantly affect sounding accuracy. If water level values are not properly measured and
applied, then hydrographic error budget requirements may not be met.


#### 1.5.8.1 Calibration Requirements & Methods

Tide gauges, batteries, GOES antennas, battery cables, regulators, and other tide gauge equipment are typically
maintained and calibrated (if necessary) by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services
(CO-OPS) staff on an annual basis. Field units should contact the local Operations Branch of the CO-OPS
Field Operations Division immediately after the close of the field season to arrange for servicing of any gauges
deployed with the unit. As the field unit prepares for the upcoming field season, the unit should discuss tide gauge
requirements with FOD as soon as project assignments are known.

Field units should thoroughly test all tide gauge equipment, including that serviced by CO-OPS, as part of the
Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review process.


#### 1.5.8.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

When a field unit installs a tide gauge for hydrographic surveys, it is responsible for operation and maintenance
of that gauge for the duration of the survey. As such, it behooves the hydrographer to conduct a full functional
check of all gauge equipment immediately prior to installation. Once the gauge is installed, the following checks
should be conducted:
•	 The hydrographer should monitor the daily Hydro Hotlist email to ensure that gauge data are being received
by CO-OPS and pass quality checks. (Note: the hydrographer must specifically request CO-OPS to add gauges
to the Hydro Hotlist. See section 3.5.2.3.1 on page 86 for additional information.)
•	 If GOES transmissions are not possible from the tide station site, the hydrographer should visit the station
every few days to ensure that data are being recorded. The hydrographer should download recorded data on
these visits, check the water levels to ensure a smooth curve consistent with predictions (if available), and
transmit the data to CO-OPS.

•	 Regardless of the status of the satellite uplink, the hydrographer should visit the station site approximately
weekly to check the physical integrity of the installation. These checks should include the following:		
	
•	 Confirm that gas pressure is adequate to last until the next visit, and check for gas leaks at tubing 		
	 connections (for bubbler gauges).

	
	

*Page 31*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	

• Check battery voltage to confirm that the solar cells are providing adequate charging current.


	
	

• Check for physical stability of the gauge by performing a minimum of 2 hour of staff readings for
comparison with recorded data.


•	 These station checks are particularly critical immediately before and after an extended absence from the
survey area (such as a port call).

If problems are observed with water level data an on-site assessment should be conducted and field units should
contact CO-OPS to determine the preferred course of action.


#### 1.5.8.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Since tide gauge equipment is maintained by CO-OPS, annual field unit calibrations are not required. Tide gauges
do not need to be addressed during Hydrographic Systems Reviews aside from being listed in the Hardware
Systems Inventory. Any tide gauge problems encountered during survey operations shall be described, including
any subsequent effects to survey data, in applicable DAPRs or DRs.


### 1.5.9 Leveling Equipment

Geodetic leveling equipment is used to measure elevation differences between benchmark locations and to extend
vertical control from established benchmarks to water level measuring equipment or a water level staff. For
hydrographic survey operations, this equipment consists of a compensator leveling instrument and level rod. The
quality of the vertical datum measured is partially dependent on the quality of the leveling performed between
benchmarks and the water level staff or equipment. It is important to properly maintain leveling instruments and
rods to ensure that they are within calibration tolerances.

It is OCS policy to follow the standards and procedures established by CO-OPS for calibrating and operating
leveling equipment used to survey water level stations. These requirements are described in the NOS User’s
Guide for the Installation of Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Water Level Stations, published by
CO-OPS and included on the Hydrosoft website. These requirements are summarized here, but the hydrographer
should refer to the User’s Guide for specific information on leveling operations.


#### 1.5.9.1 Calibration Requirements & Methods

For OCS hydrographic survey operations, level surveys shall be conducted to at least third order accuracy standards.
The minimum scale calibration standard for level rods being used for third order surveys is the manufacturer’s
standard. Level rods do not have a recommended time period between scale calibrations. If an error is suspected
in a rod scale, the rod may be calibrated and certified by an approved laboratory.

No leveling instrument is perfectly aligned. The angle from which the line of sight departs from the actual level
surface when the instrument is leveled is referred to as collimation error. To minimize collimation error, the
leveling instrument shall be serviced and adjusted during Annual Systems Preparation and whenever a collimation
error cannot be reduced to acceptable tolerances in the field. This service shall be performed by a qualified,
manufacturer-approved technician.


*Page 32*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The hydrographer shall verify the collimation of leveling instruments after annual calibration. Collimation shall
be checked according to either of the two approved methods described in section 3 of the User’s Guide. The
collimation error should be no greater than ± 0.05 mm/m. If it exceeds this tolerance, the level instrument must be
adjusted and another check performed. Collimation Checks shall be processed and documented on NOAA Form
75-29 (or an equivalent) according to the procedure and example in section 3 of the User’s Guide.

#### 1.5.9.2 Periodic Quality Assurance Checks

Collimation and general performance of leveling equipment shall be verified prior to each leveling survey by
repeating the collimation check. If collimation error exceeds ± 0.05 mm/m, the level instrument must be adjusted
and another check made until the error can be successfully reduced below this threshold.


#### 1.5.9.3 Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Collimation check and calibration records for leveling equipment used for OCS hydrographic surveys shall be
maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request
of OCS. Leveling equipment and dates of calibration shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory.
Documentation for any subsequent collimation checks and/or calibrations conducted shall be included in the
DAPR for each applicable project.


### 1.5.10 Horizontal & Vertical Control Equipment

No standard calibration requirements have been implemented at this time for horizontal and vertical control
equipment. This equipments calibration requirements and quality assurance checks should be maintained per the
manufacturer’s recommendations until further guidance is provided.


#### 1.5.10.1 Documentation & Reporting Requirements

Note: Calibration and quality assurance documentation for horizontal and vertical control equipment used for
hydrographic surveying shall be maintained by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic
Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. Horizontal and vertical control equipment and dates of calibration
(if applicable) shall be reported in the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Documentation for any subsequent
calibrations or quality assurance checks conducted shall be included in the DAPR for each applicable project.


### 1.5.11 Reference Surface

Once all sonar and ancillary instrument calibrations have been performed, field parties shall assess the combined
effects of vessel offsets, patch test biases, and sonar bottom detection for each vessel-sounder combination by
comparing data and grids over a known reference surface. This is a capstone of the system preparation process,
as it combines the data from all constituent systems for an assessment of the final result.

In the event there is only one vessel and sensor, a comparison should be made with another field unit or data
from previous years if possible. If there is no previous coverage readily available, a self-comparison of reference
surfaces shall be conducted. Self-comparisons cannot be used to check for overall vertical biases, but are useful
for checking for other data anomalies.


*Page 33*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: this section assumes testing of multibeam echsounders. However, testing vertical beam echosounder
systems over a multbeam reference surface can also provide useful results.

Field units are encouraged to collaborate in establishing and using reference surfaces. Ideally, these would be
located in an area to which field units could return annually or as needed, with all datasets centrally archived for
future comparison.



#### 1.5.11.1 Reference Surface Acquisition and Processing

A grid pattern (shown in Figure 1.7) should be acquired with each sonar-vessel combination for a robust comparison:
	
•	
		
		

The grid should be planned over a relatively flat area of depth appropriate for the sonar under 		
evaluation. (It may be helpful if the test area includes a few discrete features such as wrecks or 		
rocks, but this is not required.)

	
•	
		

Survey lines should be planned for at least 100% coverage in each direction, leading to ~200%
coverage over the entire grid.


	
•	
		
		
		

The reference surface should be sized to produce a minimum of approximately five million
soundings per echosounder head. This is necessary to provide a statistically significant sample 		
size for each beam of the sonar. Larger surfaces will typically improve analysis results, but 		
obviously at the expense of acquisition and processing time.


	
•	
		

Sonars should be operated (vessel speed, system settings) as they would ordinarily be for
standard survey operations in the area.


	
•	
		
		

Settings (beam type-EA/ED, power, gain, pulse width, absorption, spreading) should be the same 	
for the comparative systems, but may differ for different frequencies of the same sonar. For
example, for the Reson7125, the 200kHz may have settings that differ from the 400kHz system.


	
•	
		
		

All necessary data correctors such as delayed heave, tide, sound speed, and TPU shall be
acquired and applied to the data. Incorporating the techniques of Ellipsoidally-Referenced Sur		
veys (ERS), in addition to traditional tides, can help minimize errors associated with water levels.

	

Backscatter data should be acquired concurrent with bathymetry data.


•	

	
•	
		

Ideally, all of a field unit’s sonar-vessel combinations should be tested in reasonably quick
succession to limit influence of environmental changes.

which displayed a mixture of flat bottom, sand waves, and targets (buoy blocks).

Once gross fliers have been removed, the data for each unique vessel/sonar combination should be gridded using
CUBE at the highest resolution at which the dataset can support a minimum of five soundings per node (ideally,
twice the maximum standard required survey resolution for the depth of the test area, i.e. 2.5% water depth). In
addition, the backscatter should be mosaicked at appropriate resolution. A number of tests are now advised, including:
	
•	
		

Visually check each surface for any data artifacts, especially those associated with offset issues, 		
poor patch test values, timing errors, or incorrect motion stabilization application.


	
•	
		

Assess the computed total propagated uncertainty and standard deviation of each reference
surface, comparing these uncertainty estimates to IHO thresholds.


	
•	
		
		
		
		

Compute difference surfaces to compare the surfaces of different vessel/sonar combinations
acquired at roughly the same time (consider performing these differences with data referenced to 		
both tidal and ellipsoidal reference frames). Compare the difference values with the estimated 		
uncertainty for each of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds. (This tests inter-system 		
agreement).


	
•	
		
		
		

Compute difference surfaces to compare each vessel/sonar combination with results from the 		
same combination from previous years (again, consider performing these differences with 		
data refer enced to both tidal and ellipsoidal reference frames). Compare the difference 			
values with the estimated uncertainty for each of the comparison grids, and the IHO thresholds.


	
•	
		

Perform a beam-by-beam statistical comparison of the processed soundings against the reference 		
grid composed of the same data. The HIPS beam-by-beam analysis tool may be the most

*Page 35*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


		
		

appropriate method. Examine results for beam-specific biases or noise. (This tests internal-con		
sistency of the sonar, and helps identify faulty segments of the transducer or beamformer).


	
•	
		
	

As an alternative or in addition to the beam-by-beam comparison, two separate surfaces at lower 		
resolution (one from each 100% coverage) can be created, and differenced. (This will help 		
assess internal consistency of the data, but will not highlight problem segments of a sonar swath).

	
•	
		
		
		

Backscatter analysis is more qualitative, but assessments may include visual assessment of the 		
mosaic for any obvious artifacts which could be associated with a sonar malfunction, inter-		
system comparison, and year-to-year comparison of backscatter acquired with the same sonarvessel system.


#### 1.5.11.2 Periodic Qualify Assurance Checks

Reference surfaces and associated data analysis should be performed as part of any new sonar-vessel system commissioning, and at least annually as part of the Hydrographic System Readiness Review. Additional tests may
be advisable after significant changes to the sonar-vessel system, or if any data qualify concerns emerge from
standard survey data.


#### 1.5.11.3 Reporting Requirements

As the reference surface test is a capstone of the overall Hydrographic System Readiness Review (HSRR) Process, any results which indicate concerns in the overall health of the sonar-vessel system(s) shall be discussed in
the HSRR Memo.

A fuller description of reference surface process and results shall be included in the DAPR as an attachment. The
exact format is left to the discretion of the hydrographer, but it should include the following:
	
•	
Description of the reference surface area in sufficient detail to allow other units to utilize the 		
		same location
	

•	

A full description of the system combination tested

	
•	
		

A brief description of data acquisition and processing, including discussion of any problems en		
countered or non-standard procedures followed

	
	
	

•	

Results and discussion of the comparison tests performed

•	

Any recommendations

The following is an example discussion of Reference Surfaces from NOAA Ship Rainier:
As an example, part of the Rainier’s HSRR process involves creating nine reference surfaces for the purposes of
calibrating their four survey launches (with their nine associated transducers).” One sonar is arbitrarily declared
the “baseline”, and all surfaces are then differenced from this baseline (Figure 1.8). Once these differences are
known, statistics are generated, visualized and appropriately interpreted (Figure 1.9). In the example shown in
Figure 1.9 all three sonars mounted to Launch 2803 (green) exhibited a 6-7cm bias as compared to the other ves36

sels (when referenced to MLLW); a bias that was mitigated when comparisons were instead made on the ellipse.
This knowledge then informs the HSRR team to examine the parameters of Launch 2803 that are unique to the
MLLW workflow (i.e. Dynamic Draft, Static Draft, Loading, Tides or Heave). In this case, it was an erroneous
dynamic draft model due to the characteristics of the suspended 8125 sonar unique to the design of Launch 2803.
Once analysis is complete, all the systems could then be condensed into a master reference surface which can be
used as the baseline in future HSRRs.


Figure 1.8 – Tabulated differences of all sonars (2801 HF considered baseline) conducted during a single HSRR
process, referenced to both MLLW and the Ellipse.


Figure 1.9 – Graphical display of the relative differences of nine sonars’ reference surfaces, referenced to both
MLLW and the Ellipse.

1.6 Software Systems
----------------------

Computer software plays an essential role in NOAA’s hydrographic surveying operations and must be managed
with care and attention to detail. It is important that each field unit ensure during the Annual Systems Preparation,
that their systems are up-to-date with the most current approved versions of survey related software.
Field units shall operate with the most up-to-date software available; any mid-season software changes should
be carefully documented so that the field unit can revert to a prior software version if problems arise. OCS has
established the following basic guidelines for maintaining, updating and testing software.

All field units should incorporate adequate computer and software maintenance periods into their annual schedules.
This should be planned to coincide with a period of relatively low operational activity, typically winter inport
for ships. Field units should use this opportunity to install and configure software on new computer systems and
conduct comprehensive rebuilds of systems to be retained. In general, “rebuilding” a system entails the following
steps:
1. Back-up all storage devices attached to the system (local hard drives).

2. Reformat storage devices.

3. Complete any scheduled hardware upgrades (new drives, memory, etc.).

4. Load the latest approved version of the operating system and mission software (standardized to the greatest
extent possible across the platform).

5. Restore only essential data from the back-up.

This practice has been particularly useful on Microsoft Windows-based systems with multiple users, as it enforces
software and configuration standardization and limits retention of unnecessary data or software that may adversely
affect system performance.

NOAA personnel seeking information on hydrographic software updates should consult HSTP. HSTP is the first
point of contact for most commercial hydrographic software packages in use by NOAA hydrographic field units
and is directly responsible for writing and maintaining many of the in-house programs used for OCS surveys.
Prior to installing software upgrades, it should be ascertained that the new version or update has been tested and
approved for use. The field unit’s regional HSTP Field Support Liaison should be able to answer questions about
software availability and testing.

Aboard NOAA hydrographic survey ships, EED shares responsibility for maintenance of hydrographic survey
computer systems and software. Traditionally, EED has maintained computer hardware, operating systems, and
data acquisition software, while OCS has been responsible for survey planning and data processing software, but
these lines are often blurred. Shipboard hydrographers should, therefore, coordinate all software requests and
changes with the embarked Electronics Technician, as well as with HSTP.

There will be cases where a critical software problem warrants installation of an upgrade before HSTP or EED
has rigorously tested and/or verified its functionality. Hydrographers are encouraged and expected to exercise
common sense in these cases. If external testing is not possible, field units should establish an internal software
test program, document the procedures and results, and report their findings to HSTP and EED, so other units can
benefit from their experience.


*Page 38*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### 1.6.1 Types of Software Systems


#### 1.6.1.1 Computer Operating Systems (OSS)

The operating system is a computer’s most fundamental software and it affects the performance of all other
programs running on a machine. Typically, NOAA’s hydrographic survey computer systems use the Microsoft
Windows environment. New versions or significant updates (such as Service Packs) for any OS should not be
installed until the hydrographer has consulted both EED and HSTP. These groups must confirm that mission
critical software has been successfully tested under the proposed new OS version prior to installation on any
system used for hydrographic survey operations. OCS discourages major mid-season OS upgrades (for example,
switching from Windows XP to Windows 7 ) and suggests that field units attempt to maintain a standard OS on
all data acquisition and processing systems.

OCS will not notify field units of available OS upgrades unless the update is critical to maintain functionality or
compatibility with hydrographic systems. However, most OS vendors have an automatic notification system for
critical updates. Field units with Internet access can also check the OS vendors’ websites to determine if updates
are available. Complete OS upgrades should be acquired through EED (if shipboard) or via the field unit’s chain
of command.

OCS recommends that data acquisition software updates be performed during Annual Systems Preparation. Field
units wishing to install updates during normal operational periods shall contact the regional HSTP Field Support
Liaison to determine if the new version has been successfully tested in a controlled environment. Occasionally,
it may be necessary to install a critical update without prior HSTP testing. In such cases, field units should first
document the existing software version settings so that it can be reinstalled if the update causes more severe
problems. The software upgrade should then be installed on a limited basis to minimize the effects of any bugs
encountered. Proper testing of new software may require several days of standard field operations to fully assess
its functionality. Field units should process and thoroughly examine resulting data for errors prior to making a
unit-wide installation.

HSTP maintains support agreements with most manufacturers of data acquisition software packages used by
OCS. Although some companies may contact individual licensees directly when updates are available, this
communication is typically routed through HSTP or EED. When a period of relative inactivity suitable for
computer system maintenance is approaching, field units should contact the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison
and assigned EED Electronics Technician (if applicable) for any approved data acquisition software upgrades that
are available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#### 1.6.1.3 Data Processing Software

Data processing software are those programs used to manipulate and analyze survey data. Common hydrographic
data processing software packages used by NOAA field units are presented in Table 1.2. Downloads for software
and updates can typically be found at the following HSTP maintained Hydrosoft site

Table 1.2: Common OCS Data Processing Software Packages

HSTP maintains software support agreements with most data processing software manufacturers, many of which
notify users directly when new updates are available. The following update procedures for specific processing
software packages have been established by OCS:
•	 CARIS products: All NOAA hydrographic field units should be receiving weekly email from CARIS 	
describing any new releases. Any field units not subscribed to this service should contact the regional HSTP
Field Support Liaison to register.

•	 HSTP products (Pydro, Hydro_MI, Velocipy): HSTP will notify field units directly when critical updates are
available.

•	 IVS 3D: Units interested in receiving email notification of Fledermaus updates can subscribe to the IVS email
list. See http://www.qps.nl/display/fledermaus/support for more information.

•	 MapInfo: All MapInfo licenses are covered under a global maintenance plan managed by HSTP. HSTP will
notify field units directly when critical MapInfo updates or patches are available.

•	 POSPac: HSTP will notify field units directly when critical updates become available.

•	 OPUS: OPUS is not available as a standalone program, but can be found online at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/
OPUS/

•	 NGS INVERSE3D; NGS INVERSE3D can be used to perform the weekly position uncertainty check base
stations and can be downloaded at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html.

•	 VDatum: VDatum software is developed jointly by the NOS Tri-Office VDatum Team. VDatum transformations
utilize a combination of stepwise transformations between ellipsoidal, orthometric, and tidal datums, leveraging
the best available hydrodynamic models and historical tidal and geodetic data at each step. VDatum software
can be downloaded at http://vdatum.noaa.gov/.


#### 1.6.1.4 Support Software

Support software includes any packages that are used as part of the hydrographic survey process, but do not
directly interact with data. However, they may be used to create digital products that accompany survey data and,
as such, must be compatible with systems throughout OCS. Examples of support software that may be in use by
a field unit include NOAA Chart Reprojector, Paint Shop Pro or AutoCAD.

Although OCS does not notify field units of upgrades to these packages unless there is a pressing operational
need, most vendors provide email update notification to registered users. Field units should coordinate with OCS
to ensure that support software is in compliance with NOAA standards and compatible with survey systems.

### 1.6.2 Software Repositories

Once a field unit has determined that a software upgrade is approved, available, and desirable, the digital files
must be acquired. While some vendors will provide these upgrades on physical media, users are often expected to
download updates via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or from Internet websites. HSTP posts both commercial and
in-house software upgrades to OCS’s anonymous FTP server (IP address 205.156.4.84). Note: NOAA field units
can not upload data to the FTP server.

If field units are outfitted with reliable high speed Internet access, software can be easily downloaded from vendor
sites or the FTP server. However, some of NOAA’s hydrographic field units have limited bandwidth for accessing
the Internet or for receiving email attachments; thus, an alternate means of obtaining software upgrades may be
necessary. Field units should consider other connection sites, such as public libraries or Internet cafés, or contact
the regional HSTP Field Support Liaison to have updates mailed on CD or other media.


### 1.6.3 Documentation & Reporting Requirements

Each computer used to acquire or manipulate hydrographic survey data shall be included on the Software Inventory
portion of the Hydrographic Systems Inventory. Installations and updates for primary software packages shall
be recorded for each computer, as shown by the sample data (red font) included on the Software Inventory
spreadsheet. Additionally, a record of system settings for hydrographic data acquisition software shall be created
and updated throughout the field season. If a software system has the capability to output a file identifying all
configuration settings, a copy of this file will meet system settings reporting requirements. Otherwise, the field unit
will need to manually generate a digital record (e.g., a spreadsheet). Software documentation shall be maintained
by the field unit and available for review during Hydrographic Systems Reviews and at the request of OCS. A
copy of the Software Inventory and system settings records in effect during operations shall be included in the
DAPR for each respective project.


*Page 41*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1.7 Personnel Rosters
-----------------------

People are the most essential component of any hydrographic survey system, and training hydrographic personnel
is a critical element of survey preparation for any field unit. Even if all hardware and software systems are
functioning correctly, data quality and operational efficiency will suffer without properly qualified hydrographers.
Guidelines for training and qualification of hydrographic personnel are described below.

For the purposes of this manual, “hydrographic personnel” are defined as those members of a field unit’s complement
(permanent or temporary duty) whose normal duties include responsibility for any activities that directly affect
survey planning, data acquisition, or data processing. In addition to Physical Scientists, Survey Technicians,
Commissioned Officers, and others in immediate control of survey operations, this includes launch coxswains
and Officers of the Deck (OODs) responsible for operating vessels during surveying; visitors who participate in
data acquisition and processing without direct supervision; and the unit’s command. Support personnel, such as
marine engineers, stewards, and members of the deck department not acting as launch coxswains, are not typically
considered “hydrographic personnel”. However, if survey operations will be significantly impacted by any of the
aforementioned groups, e.g. an insufficient number of engineers to perform planned 24-hour operations, these
situations should be mentioned in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo described in section 1.1.1 .

### 1.7.1 Personnel Qualifications & Training

Standard hydrographic training and qualification requirements are not currently established for NOAA’s
hydrographic personnel. Therefore, it is incumbent on each field unit to establish internal standards to ensure that
hydrographic personnel are adequately qualified to safely and efficiently accomplish the unit’s mission. Such a
program of training and qualification can be crafted from any of several available components including, but not
limited to, the following:

#### 1.7.1.1 Internal Training and Qualification Standards

These are standards of training and qualification developed by the field unit to meet the particular needs of its
configuration and mission. Examples include:
•	 Launch Hydrographer-in-Charge (HIC) workbook and qualification
•	 Launch Person-in-Charge (PIC) workbook and qualification
•	 Launch Coxswain workbook and qualification
•	 Officer Of the Deck (OOD) workbook and qualification

#### 1.7.1.2 NOAA Hydrographic Training

The Office of Coast Survey organizes an annual basic hydrographic training program (“Hydrotraining”). One
session per year is offered at a location on each coast, typically Norfolk, VA and Seattle, WA, and all new survey
personnel are encouraged to attend. Subject to demand and available funding, sessions on advanced topics suitable
for hydrographers with more than one year of experience may also be offered in conjunction with the basic course.

*Page 42*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CO-OPS is available to provide training on basic tidal theory, tide gauge installation, discrete tide zoning and
TCARI methodology. Elements of these topics are covered in basic Hydrotraining, but field units may choose to
schedule additional training with CO-OPS to meet their specific needs.


#### 1.7.1.3 External Training

Hydrographers may be eligible to pursue hydrographic qualifications from an outside agency or organization such
as the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM).


### 1.7.2 Reporting Requirements

Although the Hydrographic Systems Inventory includes only a basic roster of hydrographic personnel, deficiencies
in either numbers or qualification of personnel should be noted in the Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo
described in section 1.1.1
Additionally, OCS recommends that each field unit maintain a record of personnel training and qualifications.
Formally documenting personnel training and qualifications will assist Chiefs-of-Party in assessing the readiness
of their personnel. This record can also help identify hydrographic training needs, enabling units to request and
allocate resources accordingly. Copies of curriculum and/or requirements for any internally crafted qualification
or training should be maintained by the field unit for reference purposes.



1.8 Data Storage Availability
------------------------------

An inventory of all available data storage shall be completed and documented as part of the HSRR.


*Page 43*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
