Chapter 5
===========
Data Management and Survey Deliverables
The purpose of this chapter is to define data management and deliverable requirements for NOAA field units
conducting OCS hydrographic surveys. These requirements have been established to safeguard hydrographic data
during field operations, support efficient office processing, and expedite the application of survey data to NOAA’s
navigational products.



5.1 Data Management
--------------------

A typical OCS hydrographic survey produces an extensive amount of data; thus, proper data management is
critical. Two primary components of data management are addressed in this chapter: data security, releasability,
storage, and data filing and organization. It is the field unit’s responsibility to manage all survey data such that its
security and integrity are not compromised during operations, and to efficiently transmit these data to AHB, PHB,
or other designated recipient(s).


### 5.1.1 Data Security, Releasability and Storage

Hydrographers should take special care to ensure that hydrographic data security is carried out and released
according to OCS policy. All hydrographic personnel should always consider possible liability issues that may
be associated with dissemination of preliminary data. Further guidance is given below in this section and contact
information for these authorities will be identified in the Project Instructions.

Additionally, data and reports generated while conducting OCS hydrographic surveys are official records that
must be cataloged and archived. Since the majority of these data and reports are in digital format, a field unit’s
digital data storage systems must be configured, operated, and maintained with care. Precautions should be taken
against data loss due to careless handling, accidental corruption, or system failure.


#### 5.1.1.1 Data Security

It is the field unit’s responsibility to maintain all survey records in a manner that ensures data is accessible only
to the appropriate survey personnel and system administrators. Tracking procedures should be used to identify
which personnel have performed specific tasks for all data acquisition, processing, and manipulation. Data secure
can be maintained within a field unit via a combination of procedural checklists and logs, as well as establishing
computer user accounts with password protection.

Field units may receive requests for survey data from constituents and private parties. Field units shall obtain
approval from the Chief-of-Party prior to releasing any preliminary data or products to parties outside of OCS.
Note: Any preliminary data product released must be clearly annotated in accordance with section 5.2.2.4of this
manual.


*Page 172*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A copy of all products released to the public shall be included in the Public_Relations_&_Constituent_Products
folder of the survey submission package. The field unit shall document all survey records or constituent products
officially transmitted using a digitally signed NOAA standard form Letter Transmitting Data (NOAA Form 6129), which can be created in Pydro. A record of all transmittal letters created and received should be maintained
by the field unit.


##### 5.1.1.1.1 Special Data Handling Requirements

Special handling requirements will be described in the Project Instructions from HSD Operations Branch.
Examples of situations requiring special data handling are below.

All newly discovered uncharted shipwrecks are to be treated as significant and vulnerable historic resources. This
treatment entails following the data handling guidance in section 4.4.2.4 of this manual. Raw or processed data
from sources external to NOAA are not to be made available to the public at any time.

Certain homeland security survey data have special handling requirements prescribed by the US Naval
Oceanographic Office and OCS as described in the NAVMETOCCOMINST 3142A documents included in
Appendix 2:

#### 5.1.1.2 Data Releasability

Field units or HSD/NSD office personnel should be aware that the policy information mentioned here is set forth
such that the release of raw or working data do not provide a company an unfair competitive advantage within
its industry or carry with it liability issues that may be associated with the dissemination of this data. These
policies are also set to adhere to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1996 and the Archaeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979. Information about all newly uncharted navigationally significant and potentially historical
man-made features, particularly position coordinates, is considered sensitive material. The field shall not release
this information to the general public without permission from HSD.

Figure 5.1 illustrates a general flow diagram of HSD’s processes to plan hydrographic surveys, acquire, process,
quality control and compile hydrographic data to create products.


Figure 5.1: General flow diagram of HSD’s processes.

According to the OCS Policy for the Release of Mission Data, there are three defined stages for Mission Data (see
the OCS policy for more information about each of these stages):

*Page 173*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	

	

	

•	 Raw Data: data as it is originally collected manually, from sensors, or received from other sources such 		
as other federal agencies.

•	 Working Data: data on which processing has been performed that changes the information contained in 		
the data but which is not yet processed to a level deemed as complete and suitable for public release
(e.g. data that has undergone a Survey Acceptance Review (SAR).


•	 Data Product: data which has been processed or accepted without further processing which is considered 	
	 to be suitable for release to the public and which OCS acknowledges as official (e.g. BAG after 			
	 approval).

Due to the increase in requests for digital data at all stages, HSD has been working with the National Geophysical
Data Center (NGDC), which stores this data, to release the data to the public at the following stages in HSD’s
pipeline:
	

1. After the ships have sent the raw data to NGDC.


	

2. After the working data has undergone a SAR and AHB/PHB has sent it to NGDC (Post-SAR).


	

3. After OCS acknowledges the data as official

Note: All personnel should note that all new data will be in the BAG format instead of the previously archived
ascii xyz format. The BAG format was developed to create an open source exchange format for gridded data
therefore any public requester should be able to use data in this format (see section 5.2.1.1 of the HSSD)
ONLY DATA AT NGDC CAN BE RELEASED TO A REQUESTER. HSD/NSD office personnel, responding to
a request, should direct the requester to a point of contact at NGDC (which can be identified by HSD). Official
data is available via NGDC’s website http://map.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/index.html (NGDC will have a website
for the public to retrieve raw or post-SAR data in the future).

It should be noted that field units shall NOT release raw or processed data to a requester outside of OCS. Also field
units shall NOT create specialized products in response to a data request unless authorized by their supervisor.
Data requests for processed data which are still on the vessel must comply with the guidance in section 5.2.2.4
of this manual and ensure that an effort should be made to meet the needs of the requester without being unduly
time consuming.

If the Chief Hydrographer feels the requester has reasonable cause to warrant the release of raw data which are
still on the ship and have not been sent to AHB/PHB then, (s)he must obtain written approval by the appropriate
Division Chief (i.e. the Chief, Hydrographic Surveys Division or Chief, Navigation Services Division) to release
these data. Raw data, if release is approved, should be distributed with a disclaimer describing, in general:
•	 Things that have not been done (e.g. list correctors that haven’t been applied).

•	 Uses of the raw data that are not appropriate.

•	 Anything else the Chief Hydrographer or Chief of HSD feels necessary to include.



*Page 174*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additionally, metadata should be provided in conformance with applicable standards and such metadata should be
entered in to the appropriate national metadata data base. Finally, an official record of raw data distributions shall
be made and preserved (contact the Chief of HSD/NSD for more information).

Likewise, if the Chief of AHB/PHB is forced to distribute Post-SAR (working data) or feels the requester has
reasonable cause to warrant the release of processed data which are in line to undergo a SAR, field units or HSD/
NSD office personnel responding to a request must obtain written approval by the appropriate Division Chief to
release this data. Post-SAR data, if release is approved, should have a strong disclaimer letter that accompanies
the data and indicates enough major flaws to discourage its use and further requests. Additionally, before releasing
this data three steps should be taken:
1.	 The data or a transmittal document shall be marked appropriately taking into consideration the recipients
intended use. Suitable markings might be: ’Preliminary Data – contents may change’, or ’Draft – not to be
used for navigation’, or ’Working file – processing has not been completed and significant corrections may
yet be applied’.

2.	 The recipient shall be counseled as to the known condition of the data, the nature of possible changes, and
other known considerations that would help the recipient use the data in a prudent manner.

3.	 The provider should mark the data set or accompanying transmittal document indicating to whom the file was
provided, and that the recipient was counseled as to the status of the data. The provider shall then prepare and
preserve an official record (contact the Chief of HSD/NSD for more guidance – this should be in line with
how NGDC records requests) that data was provided, to whom, for what use, on what date, that counseling
was provided, and who made the determination and released the data.


#### 5.1.1.3 Data Storage

All storage devices and media used for OCS hydrographic survey data should be approved by HSD and/or HSTP.
Field units shall not implement new data storage technology or media without first consulting HSD and/or HSTP
to verify that the system is both based on proven technology and is compatible with equipment at other NOAA
sites that may need to access the survey data.

NOAA’s hydrographic survey ships are typically equipped with Network Appliance (NetApp) data storage systems.
The NetApp system consists of dual Redundant Array of Independent Disks(RAID) arrays with independent
control heads. Each NetApp system should be set up in a mirrored crossover configuration with daily and weekly
snapshots to provide data redundancy and recoverability in case of partial system failure. With this type of system
redundancy, if one control head fails, the second will assume control of both RAID arrays; if one RAID array
fails completely, a copy of the data will remain on the second RAID. Data recoverability is provided by “point-intime” snapshots of the data that can be used to restore directories that have been inadvertently deleted or become
corrupt. OCS strongly recommends physically separating the two NetApp control heads to prevent catastrophic
data loss due to a point event such as an isolated fire.

Navigation Response Teams use a different type of data storage system to meet their specific mission needs.
typical NRT data storage systems consist of one Network Attached Storage(NAS) unit that is regularly backed
up onto an external hard drive. This type of system combination should be configured to automatically compare
the two drives for differences periodically throughout the day. If any new data are found on the NAS, those files
should be automatically mirrored onto the external hard drive.



*Page 175*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



##### 5.1.1.3.1 Data Backup Requirements

Regardless of the data storage system used, each NOAA hydrographic field unit must ensure that all survey
data that have not been previously submitted to, and accepted by, either AHB or PHB are routinely backed up.
Backups shall be performed such that a complete systems failure would result in no more than one day of data
lost. For example, weekly full backups and daily incremental backups would ensure that the maximum loss of
data would only be those files modified or created in the time between the previous incremental backup and the
failure. The method used to backup data may vary and could include CDs, DVDs, or redundant drive system.
Many backup systems, such as the NetApp, can be configured to perform scheduled backups automatically. It is
the responsibility of the field unit to verify that their backup solution is operational throughout the field season.
Note: If using a NetApp system, OCS recommends it be configured to retain 6 daily snapshots and 2 weekly
snapshots, providing access to files up to 20 days old (best case).


##### 5.1.1.3.2 Data Transfer

Data can be transferred from field units using a variety of media or portable hard drives. However, field units
should ensure that data transfer media is compatible with the data recipient’s equipment. Regardless of the method
used for data transfer, there will always be a risk of damage, loss, or corruption of data during the transfer process.
OCS recommends that field units retain a backup of any data transmitted until a successful transfer has been
confirmed by the recipient.

When survey data have been submitted to NGDC, AHB or PHB, field units are required to retain a backup of this
data until NGDC or the hydrographic branch has acknowledged that the data have been successfully archived and
the Survey Acceptance Review has been completed (the Survey Acceptance Review only pertains to processed
data). Even after data has been successfully transferred, OCS recommends the field unit retain copies of final
survey products created (e.g., PSS, DR, MapInfo tables, public outreach materials, etc) on removable storage
media if additional operations will be conducted in that general project area.


### 5.1.2 Data Filing and Organization

Due to the quantity of data generated during an OCS hydrographic survey, standardized data filing and organization
practices should be used. These methods may vary among field units during data acquisition and processing, but
it is imperative that a standardized system be used across all field units for data submission to AHB and PHB.
Clearly named files, standardized directory structures, and common practices will all contribute to efficient data
management and survey processing.


#### 5.1.2.1 Field Unit Data Directory Structure

It is very important for a field unit to establish a working data directory structure that is consistent across the
data acquisition and processing computers and storage devices throughout the unit. When designing a working
directory structure, any specific software requirements must be considered. For example, CARIS HIPS/SIPS
data must be configured with a specific directory structure so that referenced information can be accessed by the
software. An expanded view of a sample CARIS directory structure is shown in Figure 5.2.



*Page 176*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Figure 5.2: Field unit directory structure.

OCS recommends that field units store raw and post-processed data in separate directories. Typically, raw data
will be organized by survey registry number with subfolders further sorting the data by acquisition system type,
then by vessel (HVF name), by day, and finally by line. This type of file structure is referred to as PVDL (Project/
Vessel/Day/Line).

Note: The “vessel” subfolder name must be identical to the CARIS HIPS Vessel File (HVF) name for the data it
contains.

Post-processed data are typically organized by survey registry number and then subdivided according to the
directory structure required by CARIS HIPS/SIPS software.

Raw data files are often quite large. As a result, storage of raw data may become unmanageable if many surveys
are in progress at once. Therefore the field unit shall transmit a project’s survey sheet to NGDC prior to submission
of the remaining survey records to AHB or PHB. The field unit shall follow standard data submission procedures
as documented in section 8.4 of the HSSD and the standard data directory structure as shown below in figure 5.3.
The Raw Public folder shall contain all pre-processed sonar (bathymetry and backscatter if applicable) and sound
speed profile data acquired for the survey. Raw sonar data should be organized by acquisition system, vessel
(HVF name), and day number. For example, if mainscheme MBES data was acquired by NOAA Ship Thomas

*Page 177*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Jefferson on 27 June 2006 for survey H12345, the file structure might be: H12345_MBES > TJ_S222_Reson7125
> 2006_178. If rejected and/or non-converted sonar files are submitted they should be contained in a separate
folder designated for that purpose. Raw sound speed profile data should be separated into subfolders by vessel
hull number and day. The configuration file (*.con) for each sound speed profiling instrument used for survey
operations must be included in the Preprocess folder.

Once the field unit receives notification from NGDC that all data have been successfully archived, the field unit
may remove the corresponding raw data from their system.


Figure 5.3: Field Unit Raw Data Directory Structreu.



#### 5.1.2.2 Survey Data Submission Directory Structure

Since surveys are submitted to the hydrographic branches from several NOAA field units and each survey includes
data from numerous sources, standardized data submission practices shall be used to support efficient office
processing and verification. The standard file structure to be used by NOAA field units when submitting OCS
hydrographic survey data to either AHB or PHB is outlined below, with a brief description of each section. A
pictorial representation of this file structure is shown in Figure 5.4. Specific survey deliverables are discussed in
section 5.2 See Appendix 5 for a (Digital Data Submission Checklist).

Note: If files to be included in a specific subfolder have either not been generated at the time of data submission
or are not required for a specific survey, the subfolder shall not be eliminated from the directory structure even
though it is empty. By maintaining the complete submission directory structure, a data recipient can quickly verify
that no items have been overlooked or inadvertently moved/deleted.


##### 5.1.2.2.1 Field Unit_YYYY (e.g., RAINIER_2006)

This folder shall be named to identify the field unit and year of data submission. It should contain any pertinent
information that applies to all hydrographic survey data acquired by that unit over the course of the year specified.
At a minimum, the following subfolder shall be included:
HSRR - Include a digital copy of the field unit’s Hydrographic Systems Readiness Memo and corresponding
Hydrographic Systems Readiness Acknowledgment as defined in Chapter 1 of this manual.

should be removed from this folder prior to data submission.

H12345 - This fieldsheet should contain all finalized BASE surfaces and mosaics for
the survey. If, for data management, multiple fieldsheets are necessary to represent final
survey data, fieldsheets shall be named such that the contents are easily inferred (e.g.

H12345_SSS). Each BASE surface shall be named such that the survey registry number
and BASE surface resolution are identified (e.g., H12345_50cm_A, H12345_1m_B, or
H12345_2m_B). There shall be absolutely no periods or special characters used in the
surface names.

Each side scan mosaic shall be named such that the survey registry number, mosaic
resolution, and SSS percentage are clearly identified. For example, a first 100% SSS mosaic
at three meter resolution would be named H12345_3m_100. A corresponding 200% SSS
mosaic would be named H12345_3m_200. There shall be absolutely no periods or special
characters used in the mosaic names.

HDCS_DATA -This folder shall contain all post-processed data generated in CARIS for the survey being 	
			
submitted. Data shall be further organized using subfolders to create a Project Vessel/

project (OPR-A###-AA-YY_HVCR.pdf) and any supporting information as defined by the HSSD and section
5.2.2.2.3 of this manual. No report is necessary if no HorCon and/or VerCon were conducted; however, a text
document stating that no HorCon and/or VerCon operations were conducted shall be placed in this folder in lieu
of an HVCR.

Project Correspondence - Include all project correspondence such as documented telephone conversations
and email correspondence that pertain to the survey being submitted.


Figure 5.4: Submission Directory Structure


*Page 181*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#### 5.1.2.4 Naming Conventions

It is critical that file naming conventions be standardized to quickly communicate what information a file contains.
(See section 8.1 of the HSSD for specific file names). As a standard practice, use the survey registry number
(H12345) rather than survey priority designations when naming survey files. Any files submitted that will be
unfamiliar to the receiving hydrographic branch and/or do not follow standard naming conventions shall be
accompanied by a separate digital text document fully describing the file(s). This text file shall be named “read
me”, with an appropriate extension, and should be located at the top level of the directory structure containing the
unfamiliar or non-standard files.



5.2 Survey Deliverables
------------------------

Survey deliverables refer to all data, reports, and products associated with an OCS hydrographic survey that will
be approved and submitted by a NOAA field unit. When submitting a survey to AHB or PHB, the data deliverables
shall include all data and information necessary for office verification, including the ability to manipulate data if
necessary, thorough documentation of the field unit’s survey procedures, and results and recommendations for the
survey. Some survey deliverables, such as DTON Reports, the Request for Tides, Coast Pilot Review, and NODC
files, have additional and/or unique submission requirements. All required OCS hydrographic survey deliverables
and any specific submission requirements are briefly described in the following sections.


### 5.2.1 Digital Data

If possible, all data shall be submitted to AHB or PHB in digital format. This requirement includes documents that
can be easily scanned into *.pdf files, such as memos, system calibration reports, and DP reports. Digital data shall
be submitted using the directory structure described in section 5.1.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 5.4, see section 8.1
and L Appendix 12 of HSSD for further details. Only data that pertains to the survey being submitted should be
included in the digital data deliverables. All preliminary, temporary, or working data files shall be removed prior
to submission.

Prior to submitting digital data, the field unit shall verify that all files are present and none have become corrupt
during transfer to a portable media.

The field unit shall generate a UNIX formatted MD-5 hash of the content of the entire directory structure and
include it in the digital data submission. This shall be done using FileVerifier++ following the FileVerifier++ SOP
in Appendix 5.

Additionally, a digital directory listing of data on the transfer media should be created and compared to the original
file structure. The field unit shall include this directory listing, as a text file named to reference the transmittal
letter number, in the data submission package. This directory listing can be generated and automatically sent to
a text file by typing “dir /s submission directory name > transmittal reference number.txt” (e.g., dir /s H12345 >
RU-2-06.txt) at the Windows Command Prompt.

To ensure that a complete data recovery is possible in case of lost mailings or media problems, the procedures
below shall be followed by each field unit when submitting final digital survey data to AHB or PHB:
•	 Verify that backups of all data being submitted have been made and are securely stored. Backups must be in a
format that can be readily restored at the receiving Hydrographic Branch.


*Page 182*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 Review the content of all backups and deliverable digital media to ensure they are complete, accurate, and
structured in accordance with OCS specifications.


	

•	 Retain the backup for a survey until notified by AHB or PHB that the data have been successfully archived
and the Survey Acceptance Review has been completed (Survey Acceptance Review is only required for
processed data).


#### 5.2.1.1 POSPac Deliverables

NOAA field units using POSPac MMS processing may satisfy the ERS based deliverables defined in section 8.4.5
of the HSSD with the following items:
Raw Files
•	 Raw POSPac Files with naming convention YYYY_DDD_VSSL.000 (ex. 2010_123_S220.000)
•	 Files shall be Unlimited in size but not more than 24 hours long.

•	 Base Station Files in native format, if native format is other than RINEX

Note: Substitutes for POSPac plots may be acceptable if they provide all the information needed in a format
acceptable to HSD and are agreed upon ahead of time by the field unit, receiving branch, and OPS.

### 5.2.2 Reports and Field Products

Various reports and field products will be generated in conjunction with an OCS hydrographic survey. Survey
reports can be divided into three tiered categories. Field Unit Reports refer to those providing information
that encompasses the entire field unit and its operations. Project Reports are those containing information that
applies to all surveys completed (or to be completed) within a project for a specific year. Project Reports may
reference information contained in Field Unit Reports, provided the referenced document is clearly identified and
readily available for review. Survey Reports contain information specific to only one survey and may reference
information contained in both Field Unit Reports and Project Reports, provided the referenced documents are
clearly identified and readily available for review.

This section of the FPM provides an overview of reports and products to be submitted in conjunction with
every OCS hydrographic survey completed by a NOAA field unit. Each of these reports shall be delivered to the
hydrographic branch that supports that field unit unless a different recipient is explicitly identified either in this
manual or the Project Instructions.



*Page 184*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#### 5.2.2.1 Field Unit Reports


##### 5.2.2.1.1 Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR) Memo

The only OCS-mandated Field Unit Report is the annual Hydrographic Systems Readiness Review (HSRR)
Memo (see Appendix 1). The HSRR Memo is to be submitted on an annual basis within 10 working days of
commencing survey operations at the start of the field season. Details on the submission of the HSRR Memo are
in 1.1.1 .


#### 5.2.2.2 Project Reports


##### 5.2.2.2.1 Survey Progress and Vessel Utilization Reports

Monthly Survey Progress Estimates (formerly Progress Sketch), Project Statistics and Vessel Utilization
worksheets shall be submitted as one workbook to progress.sketches@noaa.gov, along with a courtesy copy to
either the AHB or PHB Chief (AHB.Chief@noaa.gov or PHB.Chief@noaa.gov, in accordance with the guidance
below by the fifth day of the month following survey operations. To assist in the submission of this information,
at the beginning of the field season, HSD Operations Branch will provide each ship with a Monthly Report Excel
file with three separate worksheets as indicated below.

Survey Progress Estimate – This will be used to track estimated monthly survey progress by area within
a given month. It will be a spreadsheet that consists of rows showing the vessel’s current project and all
associated survey sheets. Column titles are self-explanatory. For each month that data is acquired on a
survey sheet (as well as sheets that are still incomplete) the cumulative percentage completed through the
end of that month should be entered in the spreadsheet. Any modifications to the initial survey sheet layout
must be reported.

Project Statistics – This will be used to track monthly statistics other than square nautical miles. Since each
row of the spreadsheet represents a specific project within a given month, the field is advised to maintain
one sheet for the entire fiscal year and submit the updated version every month. The following provides
clarification of the columns within the spreadsheet:
	

•	 The “LNM VBES” (vertical beam echo sounder), “LNM MB” (multibeam), and “LNM SSS’ (side scan
sonar) are for the purpose of reporting operations using only one sonar sensor.

•	 The “LNM Combo” is for reporting LNM if a combination of sensors is used., such as side scan and 		
	 single beam or multibeam and side scan.

•	 The LNM above are to be subdivided between ship and launch platforms as appropriate.

•	 “Items Investigated” includes the number of AWOIS items or newly discovered items that require extra 		
	 survey time.



*Page 185*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	 “Tide Gauges Installed/Removed” and “Bottom Samples” are the only other stats needed from NOAA 		
	 survey vessels. Contractors are still required to report Days at Sea (on site working on the project) 		
	 and days (or fraction of days) lost due to weather or equipment malfunction.

Vessel Utilization Report – The purpose of this form is to collect data that will highlight the areas that are having
the greatest effect on productivity and may be in need of additional resources. A brief description of the various
columns is below:
•	 Comment – short description of survey activities and lost productivity.

•	 Days at Sea (DAS) – as defined by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (Any day in which a 		
	 vessel is at sea for at least 1 hour during a 24-hour period in support of an assigned project. DAS include 	
	 days of arrival and departure, times anchored (except during port calls) or hove-to drifting on the 		
	 working grounds, and occasions when a survey ship (even though moored) deploys 25 percent or 		
	 more of its total complement including officers and crew in field survey activities.)
	

•	 Transit (hours) – ship travel time from port to the project area or within the project area (i.e from one 		
anchorage to another – does not include launch transit time between ship and survey area). Transit hours 		
are in support of surveys but should not be counted as planned/actual survey hours.


•	 Ship/launch planned and actual survey hours - number of hours planned at the beginning of each day for 		
each platform if all equipment is operating properly and if the authorized number of skilled personnel 		
	 are available; hours planned may be increased during the day due to reflect a change in plans (e.g. late 		
	 launches) but should rarely, if ever, be decreased; the number of actual hours worked for each platform. 		
	 Note: actual hours can never be greater than planned hours.

	
	

•	 Vessel Utilization - percentage (rounded to the nearest decimal) of planned hours that were actually 		
worked; this number should not be affected by time lost due to routine mechanical/electrical 			
maintenance or safety stand down days.


•	 Weather/Safety Stand down (hours) - hours of production lost due to weather or safety stand down 		
	 (divided between ship and launches)
•	 Unscheduled Maintenance or Equipment Issues (hours) - hours of production lost due to unscheduled 		
	 repairs to non-survey equipment.

	

•	 Downtime due to Survey Equipment Issues (hours) - hours of production lost due to problems related to 		
survey equipment.


	

•	 Downtime due to Personnel Shortage (hours) - hours of production lost due to shortage of personnel or 		
shortage of personnel with requisite skill level.


It is understood that the determination of planned survey hours is very subjective and dependent upon numerous
factors including the requirement to process acquired data in a timely fashion and the availability of vessels and
personnel.

##### 5.2.2.2.5 Coast Pilot Review

A Coast Pilot Review shall be completed for each project in accordance with section 7.4 of the HSSD and section
3.5.7 of this manual. The products shall be and submitted to NSD’s Coast Pilot Branch via email to OCS.NDB@
NOAA.GOV and Coast.Pilot@NOAA.GOV with a courtesy copy to the appropriate hydrographic branch and the
HSD OPS project planner.”
Coast Pilot Reviews shall be submitted following the completion of operations within a project area, and no later
than at the time of submission of the first Descriptive Report for that project. If a survey project spans multiple
years, a Coast Pilot Review shall be submitted at the conclusion of operations within the affected area each field
season so that edits can be reviewed and applied to the Coast Pilot prior to compilation of source data for the
following field season.


#### 5.2.2.3 Survey Reports


##### 5.2.2.3.1 Descriptive Report (DR)

For each survey, a Descriptive Report shall be completed in accordance with section 8.1.4 of the HSSD and
Chapter 5 of this manual. Information contained in the DAPR may be referenced in the DR to meet reporting
requirements set forth in the HSSD.


###### 5.2.2.3.1.1 Pydro Chartlets

Pydro supports creation of automated “cookie cut” chartlets for features using OpenGL-based “HSTP Control”
ChartWindow. From the ChartWindow context menu, select “Screen Capture” -> “Auto Chartlets”. A subsequent
dialog allows you to specify a feature tree template filter to control which items/features have chartlets generated
(empty template implies use all features). Chartlets are saved in a user-specified directory in PNG format. The
visible data content within each chartlet is as per the plot configuration as seen in the Pydro ChartWindow.
The Auto Chartlets command can be executed multiple times to generate more than one chartlet view for any
feature(s). Pydro automatically generates unique chartlet names, so the same output directory can be used each
time–no existing files will be overwritten. The Chartlets get a default caption in the Pydro PSS, listing the center
position in decimal degrees and the width and height in meters of each chartlet image. PSS chartlet output is
supported in all Pydro reporting options. The Pydro DTON report includes a Zip archive containing the .xml and
.pdf files, as well as a DTONImages folder containing all of relevant chartlets (always included) and report images
(user selectable).


###### 5.2.2.3.1.2 Pydro Line Classification

Pydro supports classification of HIPS/SIPS survey lines in compliance with HSSD. Lines can be classified
in Pydro according to “mode” and “type”. Line mode includes “Interferometric”, “Multibeam”, “Shoreline”,
“SideScanSonar”, “SingleBeam”, and “UnclassifiedMode”; multiple modes can be selected per line (not to
include “UnclassifiedMode”). Line type includes “Crossline”, “Development”, “Mainscheme”, “Other”, and
“UnclassifiedType”; only one type can be selected per line. Pydro line classification is accessible in the Data ->
Stats -> “PVDL / In Bathy Info” and “Survey Line Info” dialogs. Any HIPS/SIPS survey lines can be brought into
Pydro via Data -> Insert -> “HIPS/SIPS Survey Lines”, without the added expense of inserting any associated
feature or bathymetry data into the PSS. Survey line data read in this way does include the survey track and
swath-bathymetry coverage limits (if any), and can therefore be used in Pydro to compute linear nautical miles

*Page 189*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(LNM) and to index full-density PVDL depth data. The Pydro information dialogs include a versatile HIPS/SIPS
PVDL-filtering engine that can be used to compute LNM for any particular line mode/type classification, for any
subset of project(s), vessel(s), day(s), and line(s). Each filtering category includes a choice of the use of inclusive
or exclusive logic.


###### 5.2.2.3.1.3 Pydro Surface-Points Comparisons

Point and surface data comparison statistics can be compiled and reported in Pydro via Reports -> “Points/Surface
Stats”: - Items for localized comparison points can be those as filtered using any feature tree template, not just
“Checkpoints” - Reference surface data choices include HIPS BASE/weighted grid data, in addition to PVDL
binned depth data - Reference surfaces can be filtered according to precision - Comparison point data choices
include HIPS BASE/weighted grids, PVDL depths, and the localized comparison item depth data - Greater control
over PDF report output: grouped summary or localized details of cumulative and/or by beam or depth bin - Option
for graphs and/or tabular output; graphing options for by-beam or by-depth bin and a “IHOness” pie chart of
surface-minus-depth pass/fail percentages - Reference surface image output options: (filtered) bathy and (filtered)
precision, as well as item/feature report images and chartlets.


##### 5.2.2.3.2 Survey Outline

Upon completion of data acquisition for a survey, submit a final survey outline to survey.outlines@noaa.gov in
accordance with the Project Instructions and section 8.1.2 of the HSSD.


##### 5.2.2.3.3 Request for Tides

Within 24-hours of completion of data acquisition for a survey, a request for final discrete zoning (often referred to
as a “final tides request”) shall be submitted to CO-OPS. Pydro should be used to automatically generate a zipped
digital “Request for Tides” package that contains all of the survey information needed by CO-OPS. The package
includes a formal memorandum requesting approved water level data, an Abstract of Times of Hydrography,
and digital *.MID and *.MIF files of survey track lines. Submit the Request for Tides package via email to
final.tides@noaa.gov, with the project number referenced in the email subject line. Once this request has been
received, CO-OPS has agreed to provide field units with final water level correctors relative to the appropriate
chart datum and final tidal zoning, as close to “near real-time” as possible. Final approved water levels shall be
applied to all applicable survey data before data submission to HSD. If the lack of final approved water levels
delays submission of a survey, please contact the appropriate HSD Operations Branch Chief or NSD Navigation
Response Branch Chief . The type of tide/water level file (predicted, preliminary, or verified) applied to submitted
data shall be noted in the Corrections to Echo Soundings section of the Descriptive Report. Include a copy of the
digital Request for Tides package, as well as the *CORP.tab, *STNP.tab, and *LABP.tab files applied to survey
data, in Appendix I(Tides and Water Levels) of the Descriptive Report.


##### 5.2.2.3.4 ATON Report

Information for each USB assigned ATON and any additional ATONs which should be reported based on the
criteria defined in section 3.5.3.3 of this manual shall be submitted to MCD at the completion of a survey. Refer
Appendix 5 of the FPM for an example of the (Fixed Aton Report.pdf),created by MCD to facilitate a standardized
submission.


*Page 190*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Field units shall submit an ATON Report of all ATONs investigated directly to MCD via email to aton.reports@
noaa.gov. Courtesy copies shall be provided to the Chief of the appropriate hydrographic branch and either Chief
of OPS or Chief of NRB. A copy of the ATON Report and processed data record shall also be included in Appendix
II (Supplemental Survey Records and Correspondence) of the Descriptive Report.


##### 5.2.2.3.5 Data Directory Size Report

After data acquisition is complete for each survey, send an e-mail indicating the survey/project number, survey
platform, raw MBES and/or VBES directory size, and raw SSS directory size to NGDC at hydro.info@noaa.gov
with a copy to the chief of the appropriate processing branch.


#### 5.2.2.4 Public Relations and Constituent Products

Any preliminary survey products, including public relation documents (chartlets, sounding plots, images, mosaics,
DTMs, etc.) created by the field unit at the request of any parties outside of OCS (pilots, harbor masters, port
authorities, other NOAA offices, etc.), that detail any surveyed information or significant discoveries made during
a project are important documents that often support NOAA public relations and presence in an area. These
documents can and will be used in various ways that are often unknown to the field unit that provided that product.
Therefore, it is essential that each document contain a minimum amount of metadata to inform both the recipient
of the document and NOAA offices of the origin and particulars of the data. A digital copy (preferably PDF) of
any preliminary product delivered to a local constituent should be included with the survey deliverables.
The minimum elements suggested in each document are:
	

1. Title bar or block (include the name of the local area in title)

	

2. Date and registry number of the survey

	

3. Field unit acquiring the data

	

4. Type of equipment used to acquire the data (EM3002, Klein 5000, Klein 3000, Reson 7125, etc.)

	
	
	

5. If a sounding plot, a statement stating: Soundings in (feet, fathoms or meters) at (MLLW, ITRF 00, 		
etc.) corrected using (predicted tides, preliminary observed tides, verified observed tides, Vdatum, 		
ellipsoidally referenced)

	

6. A scale bar with units

	

7. Legend (i.e. red=0-10 feet/fathoms, yellow=10-20 feet/fathoms, etc.)

	

8. A north arrow (if applicable)

	

9. Graticules (labeled Lat/Long grid)

	
	
	

10. A disclaimer stating: “Data reflect the state of the sea floor in existence on the day and at the time the 	
survey was conducted. The survey and the chart have not been updated for inclusion of the latest 	 	
Local Notice to Mariners. Preliminary data subject to office review. Not for use in navigation.”

	

11. Optional: Contact information and/or NOAA website

*Page 191*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Prior to releasing any preliminary survey data to parties outside of OCS, personnel shall first obtain approval
from the Chief-of-Party and notify the Chief of HSD OPS or Chief of NRB. In addition to the local constituent,
the product shall be digitally submitted to the regional Navigation Manager and the Chief of HSD OPS or Chief
of NRB in a timely fashion.

All supplemental correspondence, including these preliminary data products, are to be included in Appendix
II of the DR. In addition to a digital copy of the product, it is prudent for the field unit to provide a copy of
any correspondence referring to the product, and any of the files and workspaces used to create the product (if
applicable).


### 5.2.3 NODC Files

Each time a sound speed profile is processed using Velocipy, an archive file will be automatically generated in the
proper format for submission to the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC). At the conclusion of a project,
these archive files shall be submitted to HSTP. All NODC files associated with the project should be zipped into a
single file and transmitted as an email attachment to NODC.Submissions@noaa.gov with a courtesy copy to the
Chief of HSTP. The files will be checked by HSTP and forwarded to the NODC for inclusion in the World Ocean
Database.

Be certain to submit the archive files created by Velocipy, and not the historical NODC files used by Velocipy as a
quality control tool. The NODC files to be submitted can be identified by their naming convention. The file names
will indicate the cast date and time and have an extension ending in “a” for CTD casts and “d” for sound speed
versus depth profilers, as shown below.

•	
•	
•

•	

Filename examples - YYDDDHHMM.ssa or YYDDDHHMM.ssd, where:
YY = 2-digit year
DDD = day-of-year
HH = hour of day (UTC)
MM= minutes of the hour
ss = ship code

Note: NODC files should not be included in the survey data submitted to either AHB or PHB.


### 5.2.4 Transmittal Procedures

Final survey data submitted to either AHB or PHB should be complete and not require supplemental data from
other surveys in the project. All survey data submitted shall be packaged to safeguard against loss or damage and
be accompanied by a hard copy transmittal letter (NOAA Form 61-29, Letter Transmitting Data). Additionally,
a digital copy of the transmittal letter(s) should be submitted via e-mail to the cognizant hydrographic branch at
the time the data is transferred using either LTDSubmission.AHB@noaa.gov or LTDSubmission.PHB@noaa.gov
as appropriate. If shipping more than one package, a separate transmittal should be used for each package. The
transmittal letter shall indicate the contents of the package and list all digital media being submitted (e.g., tapes,
portable hard drives, CD, DVD) with a detailed catalog of the data contained on each and the file name of the
digital directory listing created in accordance with section 5.2.1 of this manual. If additional pages are needed for
the transmittal letter, the project number and survey registry number shall be included on each page. Transmittal
letters can be created in Pydro through the Reports > NOAA Forms menu, and should be signed digitally.
